description: "When using the `remote` or `remoteSecure` table functions on a node that is located more than 100ms (latency wise) away from the remote node, it is common to encounter the following timeout error."

# Code: 279. DB::NetException: All connection tries failed.

**Problem**
[`remote()` or `remoteSecure()`](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/table-functions/remote/) table function allows the access of remote table from another ClickHouse node.

When using these functions on a node that is located more than 100ms (latency wise) away from the remote node, it is common to encounter the following timeout error.

```
4776d4bd8190 :) SELECT * FROM remoteSecure('HOSTNAME.us-east-2.aws.clickhouse.cloud', DATABASE, TABLE, 'USER', 'USER_PASSWORD')

SELECT *
FROM remoteSecure('HOSTNAME.us-east-2.aws.clickhouse.cloud', DATABASE, TABLE, 'USER', 'USER_PASSWORD')

```

**Workaround**
To get increase the connection timeout, set [`connect_timeout_with_failover_secure_ms`](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/src/Core/Settings.h#L67) to a higher value (e.g. 1 second) from the default 100ms.

```
4776d4bd8190 :) SELECT * FROM remoteSecure('HOSTNAME.us-east-2.aws.clickhouse.cloud:9440', DATABASE, TABLE, 'USER', 'USER_PASSWORD') SETTINGS connect_timeout_with_failover_secure_ms = 1000

SELECT *
FROM remoteSecure('HOSTNAME.us-east-2.aws.clickhouse.cloud:9440', DATABASE, TABLE, 'USER', 'USER_PASSWORD')
SETTINGS connect_timeout_with_failover_secure_ms = 1000
