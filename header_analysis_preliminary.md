ClickHouse attempts to group your services to reuse the same published [service endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-share-your-services.html#endpoint-service-overview) within the AWS region.

When migrating from PostgreSQL to ClickHouse, the right strategy depends on your use case, infrastructure, and data requirements.

Instead, sharding can be achieved using extensions such as [Citus](https://

Please note that canceling your marketplace PAYG subscription does not delete your ClickHouse Cloud account - only the billing relationship via the marketplace. Once canceled, our system will stop billing for ClickHouse Cloud services through the marketplace. (Note: this process is not immediate and may take a few minutes to complete).

If you want to use the same AWS Account ID for migrating your PAYG subscription to a committed spend contract then our recommended method is to [contact sales](https://clickhouse.com/company/contact) to make this amendment. Doing so means no additional steps are needed and no disruption to your ClickHouse organization or services will occur.

One of the secrets to ClickHouse query performance is compression. Less data on disk means less I/O and thus faster queries and inserts. The overhead of any compression algorithm with respect to CPU will in most cases be out weighted by the reduction in IO. Improving the compression of the data should therefore be the first focus when working on ensuring ClickHouse queries are fast.

So far so good. But let’s say we want to adjust one of the values, while leaving the other ones as they are. For example, maybe we want to double the total amount and divide the MTA tax by 1.1. We can do that by using the [`REPLACE`](/sql-reference/statements/select) modifier, which will replace a column while leaving the other ones as they are.

While merging aims to minimize the number of parts, it also balances this goal against the cost of write amplification. Consequently, some ranges of parts are excluded from merging if they would lead to excessive write amplification, based on internal calculations. This behavior helps prevent unnecessary resource usage and extends the lifespan of storage components.

Separation of storage and compute means that computing resources and storage resources are managed independently. In ClickHouse, this allows for better scalability, cost-efficiency, and flexibility. You can scale storage and compute resources separately as needed, optimizing perfo

ZooKeeper is one of the first well-known open-source coordination systems. It's implemented in Java, and has quite a simple and powerful data model. ZooKeeper's coordination algorithm, ZooKeeper Atomic Broadcast (ZAB), doesn't provide linearizability guarantees for reads, because each ZooKeeper node serves reads locally. Unlike ZooKeeper, ClickHouse Keeper is written in C++ and uses the [RAFT algo

Database ClickPipes have an architecture that consists of two parallel processes - pulling from the source database and pushing to the target database. The pulling process is controlled by a sync configuration that defines how often the data should be pulled and how much data should be pulled at a time. By "at a time", we mean one batch - since the ClickPipe pulls and pushes data in batches.

Database ClickPipes have an architecture that consists of two parallel processes - pulling from the source database and pushing to the target database. The pulling process is controlled by a sync configuration that defines how often the data should be pulled and how much data should be pulled at a time. By "at a time", we mean one batch - since the ClickPipe pulls and pushes data in batches.

Initially, we focus on the most common use case: using the Kafka table engine to insert data into ClickHouse from Kafka. The Kafka table engine allows ClickHouse to read from a Kafka topic directly. Whilst useful for viewing messages on a topic, the engine by design only permits one-time retrieval, i.e. when a query is issued to the table, it consumes data from the queue and increases the consumer

ClickHouse Connect executes all inserts within an `InsertContext`. The `InsertContext` includes all the values sent as arguments to the client `insert` method. In addition, when an `InsertContext` is originally constructed, ClickHouse Connect retrieves the data types for the insert columns required for efficient Native format inserts.

When inserting Python `datetime.datetime` objects into ClickHouse `DateTime` or `DateTime64` columns, ClickHouse Connect automatically handles timezone information. Since ClickHouse stores all DateTime values internally as timezone-naive Unix timestamps (seconds or fractional seconds since the epoch), timezone conversion happens automatically on the client side during insertion.

In practice, you may use this behavior to optimize Materialized Views that only need to process a subset of the source table's data. For example, you can use a subquery to filter the source table before joining it with other tables. This can help reduce the amount of data processed by the materialized view and improve performance.

On configuring a ClickHouse datasource in Grafana, the plugin allows the user to specify a default database and table for logs and traces and whether these tables conform to the OTel schema. This allows the plugin to return the columns required for correct log and trace rendering in Grafana. If you've made changes to the default OTel schema and prefer to use your own column names, these can be spe

The principal advantage of using a collector is it allows your services to offload data quickly, leaving the Collector to take care of additional handling like retries, batching, encryption or even sensitive data filtering.

Elasticsearch uses ingest pipelines with processors (e.g., `enrich`, `rename`, `grok`) to transform documents before indexing. In ClickHouse, similar functionality is achieved using [**incremental materialized views**](/materialized-view/incremental-materialized-view), which can [filter, transform](/materialized-view/incremental-materialized-view#filtering-and-transformation), or [enrich](/materia

The concept of sharding is fundamental to Elasticsearch's scalability model. Each ① [**index**](https://www.elastic.co/blog/what-is-an-elasticsearch-index) is broken into **shards**, each of which is a physical Lucene index stored as segments on disk. A shard can have one or more physical copies called replica shards for resilience. For scalability, shards and replicas can be distributed over seve

ClickHouse is a SQL-native engine, designed from the ground up for high-performance analytical workloads.

- If the attacker has write access to ZooKeeper and is able to run custom server available from the network where ClickHouse run, it can create custom-built malicious server that will act as ClickHouse replica and register it in ZooKeeper. When another replica will fetch data part from malicious replica, it can force clickhouse-server to write to arbitrary path on filesystem. Found by Eldar Zaitov

- The setting `input_format_defaults_for_omitted_fields` is enabled by default. Inserts in Distributed tables need this setting to be the same on cluster (you need to set it before rolling update).
