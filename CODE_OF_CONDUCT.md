# ClickHouse Community Code of Conduct
This code of conduct governs ClickHouse Community discussions, channels, and events.

## Introduction
* Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage, and desire, participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible.
* This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to build, and sustain, the diverse technical communities in which we participate.
* Our goal is to maintain a safe and friendly community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other defining characteristic.
* This code and related procedures apply to unacceptable behavior occurring in all community venues, including behavior outside the scope of community activities — online and in-person — as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

## Expected Behavior
* Be welcoming.
* Be kind and patient.
* Look out for each other.
* Be careful and aware of your wording and tone.

## Unacceptable Behavior
* Conduct or speech which might be considered sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or offensive in nature.
    * Do not use unwelcome, suggestive, derogatory or inappropriate nicknames or terms.
    * Do not show disrespect towards others. (Jokes, innuendo, dismissive attitudes.)
* Intimidation or harassment (online or in-person).
* Disrespect towards differences of opinion.
* Inappropriate attention or contact. Be aware of how your actions affect others. If it makes someone uncomfortable, stop.
* Unsolicited advertisement.
    * Do not promote competing services or companies in your messages.
    * Do not include names or logos of competing services or companies in user names or pictures.
* Not understanding the differences between constructive criticism and disparagement.
* Sustained disruptions.
* Violence, threats of violence or violent language.

## Enforcement
* Understand that speech and actions have consequences, and unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated.
* If you are the subject of, or witness to any violations of this Code of Conduct, please contact us via email at [codeofconduct@clickhouse.com](mailto:codeofconduct@clickhouse.com).
