##  Importing JSON into ClickHouse \{#importing-json-into-clickhouse\}

ClickHouse supports a wide range of [data formats for input and output](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/formats/). There are multiple JSON variations among them, but the most commonly used for data ingestion is [JSONEachRow](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/formats/#jsoneachrow). It expects one JSON object per row, each object separated by a newline.

## Examples \{#examples\}

Using [HTTP interface](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/http/):

``` bash
$ echo '{"foo":"bar"}' | curl 'http://localhost:8123/?query=INSERT%20INTO%20test%20FORMAT%20JSONEachRow' --data-binary @-
```

Using [CLI interface](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/cli/):

``` bash
$ echo '{"foo":"bar"}'  | clickhouse-client --query="INSERT INTO test FORMAT JSONEachRow"
```

Instead of inserting data manually, you might consider to use one of [client libraries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/interfaces/) instead.

## Useful Settings \{#useful-settings\}

- `input_format_skip_unknown_fields` allows to insert JSON even if there were additional fields not present in table schema (by discarding them).
- `input_format_import_nested_json` allows to insert nested JSON objects into columns of [Nested](https://clickhouse.com/docs/sql-reference/data-types/nested-data-structures/nested/) type.

:::note
Settings are specified as `GET` parameters for the HTTP interface or as additional command-line arguments prefixed with `--` for the `CLI` interface.
