## What to do \{#what-to-do\}

If you use Oracle as a source of ClickHouse external dictionaries via Oracle ODBC driver, you need to set the correct value for the `NLS_LANG` environment variable in `/etc/default/clickhouse`. 

For more information, see the [Oracle NLS_LANG FAQ](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/globalization/nls-lang-099431.html).

**Example**

``` sql
NLS_LANG=RUSSIAN_RUSSIA.UTF8
```
