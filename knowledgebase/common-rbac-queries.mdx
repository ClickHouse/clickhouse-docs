## Introduction {#introduction}

The following are common queries to help grant specific permissions to users.

## How do I grant the same permissions as the current user to another user? {#how-do-i-grant-the-same-permissions-as-the-current-user-to-another-user}

```sql
GRANT CURRENT GRANTS ON *.* TO another_user;
```

## How do I grant a specific permission to a user based on the grants of the current user? {#how-do-i-grant-a-specific-permission-to-a-user-based-on-the-grants-of-the-current-user}

In the below example, `another_user` will be able to perform `SELECT` commands on all of the databases and tables of the current user.

```sql
GRANT CURRENT GRANTS(SELECT ON *.*) TO another_user;
```

## How do I grant a specific permission to a user for a specific database based on the grants of the current user? {#how-do-i-grant-a-specific-permission-to-a-user-for-a-specific-database-based-on-the-grants-of-the-current-user}

In the below example, `another_user` will be able to perform `INSERT` commands to all tables in `my_database`.

```sql
GRANT INSERT ON my_database.* TO another_user;
```

## How do I give access to all grants for a specific user based on the default user? {#how-do-i-give-access-to-all-grants-for-a-specific-user-based-on-the-default-user}

```sql
GRANT default_role TO another_user;
```
