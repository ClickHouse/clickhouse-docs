# Does ClickHouse support row-level and column-level security?

ClickHouse and ClickHouse Cloud both support row and column-level access restrictions for read-only users necessary to achieve a role-based access control (RBAC) model. 

[Row Policies](/docs/en/operations/access-rights#row-policy-management) can be used to specify which rows will be returned to a read-only user when they query a table. ClickHouse Cloud is configured to enable the SQL-driven workflow by default. To leverage this workflow [CREATE](/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/user) a user, [GRANT](/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant) the user privileges on a table, then set the appropriate [ROW POLICY](/docs/en/operations/access-rights#row-policy-management). When the user performs a `SELECT * FROM table`, only rows allowed by the policy will be displayed.

Column-level restrictions may be specified directly using the [GRANT statement](/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant) to enable table-level access for users and roles. Users *may only* include columns for which they have access in a query. Selecting restricted columns from a table in which the user does not have access to all the specified columns, such as in the query `SELECT * FROM table`, will return an error stating the user has insufficient permissions.
