## Overview

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve the stability and reliability of our cloud services, ClickHouse Cloud will begin collecting core dumps in the event of server crashes starting on **February 27, 2026**.

Core dump collection enables us to:
- More quickly identify root causes of crashes
- Resolve issues faster
- Improve the overall service experience

## What's Collected

Core dumps capture the state of a process at the time of a crash and may include sensitive information resident in memory, such as:
- Connection credentials
- Encryption keys
- Query strings
- Other data in memory at the time of the crash

### Data Protection

- **Regional Storage**: Data is collected and stored in the same region as your service
- **Additional Protections**: Enhanced security measures are applied to collected data
- **Limited Retention**: Data is retained only for a short period to support debugging and is securely destroyed afterward

## Exclusions

The following services are **automatically excluded** from core dump collection:
- Services subject to **HIPAA** compliance
- Services subject to **PCI** compliance
- **BYOC** (Bring Your Own Cloud) services

## How to Opt Out

If you would like to opt out of core dump collection, you can do so at any time before **February 27, 2026**:

1. Navigate to the [ClickHouse Cloud Console](https://clickhouse.cloud)
2. Select your service
3. Go to the **Settings** tab
4. Locate the "Share crash reports with ClickHouse" option at the bottom of the settings page
