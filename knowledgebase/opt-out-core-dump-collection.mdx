## Overview

Starting **February 27, 2026**, ClickHouse Cloud will begin collecting core dumps when server crashes occur. This is part of our commitment to improving service reliability for all our users.

Core dump collection helps us:
- Identify and understand what caused a crash
- Fix issues more quickly
- Continuously improve your service experience

## What's collected

When a crash occurs, core dumps capture a snapshot of the server's state at that moment. We want to be transparent that this may include sensitive information that was in memory, such as:

- Connection credentials
- Encryption keys
- Query strings
- Other data in memory at the time of the crash

### How we protect your data

We take the security of this data seriously:

- **Regional Storage**: All data stays in the same region as your service
- **Enhanced Security**: We apply additional protections to all collected data
- **Limited Retention**: Data is kept only as long as needed for debugging, then securely deleted

## Services automatically excluded

Some services are automatically excluded from core dump collection:

- Services with **HIPAA** compliance requirements
- Services with **PCI** compliance requirements
- **BYOC** (Bring Your Own Cloud) services

## How to opt out

If you'd prefer not to participate in core dump collection, you can easily opt out:

1. Go to the [ClickHouse Cloud Console](https://clickhouse.cloud)
2. Select your service
3. Click on the **Settings** tab
4. Scroll to find "Share crash reports with ClickHouse"
5. Toggle the option off to opt out
