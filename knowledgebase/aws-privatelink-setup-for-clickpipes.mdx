## AWS PrivateLink setup to expose private RDS for ClickPipes {#aws-privatelink-setup-to-expose-private-rds-for-clickpipes}

Setup steps to expose a private RDS via AWS PrivateLink to ClickPipes, also supporting cross-region access.

:::info
This uses AWS Endpoint Service and is mainly suitable for Cross-Region Access. If you require same-region access,
[creating a VPC Resource](/integrations/clickpipes/aws-privatelink#vpc-resource) is
recommended instead.
:::

## Private link creation {#private-link-creation}

Follow these steps to create a **VPC endpoint service** for your RDS instance. Repeat these steps if you have multiple
RDS instances that require endpoint services (OR you may have different listener ports for different instances):

1. Locate Your VPC and [Create an NLB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/create-network-load-balancer.html)
    - Navigate to your target VPC and create a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Note that the NLB should be internal (private) and not internet-facing (public).

2. Configure the Target Group
    - The target group should point to the RDS instance's endpoint IP and Port (typically 5432 for PostgreSQL or 3306 for MySQL).

    :::note

    If you would like to automate the process of updating the target group with the new RDS endpoint IP, you can use AWS Lambda functions or other automation tools.
    One of the terraform modules that can be used for this purpose is [this](https://github.com/MaterializeInc/terraform-aws-rds-privatelink).

    :::
    - **IMPORTANT**: Make sure the RDS instance endpoint used in case of DB Cluster/Aurora is ONLY the WRITER Endpoint and NOT the common endpoint.
    - Ensure that the TCP protocol is used to avoid TLS termination by the NLB.

3. Set the Listener Port
    - The listener port of the load balancer must match the port used by the target group (typically 5432 for PostgreSQL or 3306 for MySQL).

4. Create the VPC Endpoint Service
    - In the VPC, create an endpoint service that points to the NLB.
    - Enable acceptance of connection requests from specific accounts.

5. Authorize ClickPipes to Use the Endpoint Service
    - Grant permission to the ClickPipes account to request this endpoint service.
        - Configure allowed principals by adding the following principal ID:
          ```
          arn:aws:iam::072088201116:root
          ```

6. Disable "Enforce Security Group Inbound Rules on Private Link Traffic" on the NLB (if a security group is attached to the NLB)
    - Navigate to the NLB's settings and disable the "Enforce Security Group Inbound Rules on Private Link Traffic" setting if a security group is attached to the NLB.
    - If using Terraform, set the `enforce_security_group_inbound_rules_on_private_link_traffic` attribute to `off` for the NLB
    - This setting is **required** to allow traffic from the ClickPipes VPC to the NLB.

7. **Optional**: Enable Cross-region support in case your database region is different from the ClickPipes region
    - Under `Endpoint Services` in the VPC console, select your endpoint service.
    - Click on the `Actions` button and select `Modify supported Regions`.
    - Add the regions where you want to allow access to the endpoint service, [refer here](/integrations/clickpipes#list-of-static-ips) for the list of ClickPipes regions.

## Initiating connection {#initiating-connection}

When it's done you can follow the guide to [initiate the connection](/integrations/clickpipes/aws-privatelink#creating-clickpipe)

Once the status shows `Ready` on console, you can follow the next section to create your ClickPipe.

## Creating ClickPipes {#creating-clickpipes}

Use the DNS name you got from the previous step to [create your ClickPipe](/integrations/clickpipes/postgres).

## Dynamically updating the RDS endpoint IP {#dynamically-updating-the-rds-endpoint-ip}

When the RDS endpoint IP changes (in case of restarts/failovers/updates), you need to update the NLB target group with
the new IP. You can automate this process using AWS Lambda functions or other automation tools.
