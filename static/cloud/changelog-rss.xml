      <title>ClickHouse Cloud - January 16, 2026</title>
      <link>https://clickhouse.com/docs/cloud/whats-new/cloud#january-16-2026</link>
      <description>- Service-level usage cost filtering via API:: Our API now supports filtering your organization’s usage costs by specific service tags, making it easier to analyze spend at a more granular level.
- Data Catalog integration:: You can now connect an external data catalog as a data source. ClickHouse Cloud supports AWS Glue and Unity Catalog (with more coming soon). Once connected, the catalog appears as a database, allowing you to read Iceberg tables directly—without duplicating data. For access, contact support to request access.
- ClickPipes:
- The MongoDB connector has been promoted to Public Beta, and is now available to new and existing ClickHouse Cloud customers, in all service tiers. Read the blogpost for an overview of new features and head to the documentation to get started.

      <link>https://clickhouse.com/docs/cloud/whats-new/cloud#january-18-2024</link>
      <description>General changes:
- New AWS Region: London (eu-west-2)

Console changes:
- Added ClickPipes support for Redpanda, Upstash, and Warpstream
- Made the ClickPipes authentication mechanism configurable in the UI

Integrations changes:
- Java client:
- Breaking changes: Removed the ability to specify random URL handles in the call. This functionality has been removed from ClickHouse
- Deprecations: Java CLI client and GRPC packages
- Added support for RowBinaryWithDefaults format to reduce the batch size and workload on ClickHouse instance (request by Exabeam)
- Made Date32 and DateTime64 range boundaries compatible with ClickHouse, compatibility with Spark Array string type, node selection mechanism
- Kafka Connector: Added a JMX monitoring dashboard for Grafana

- JavaScript client: Exposed query summary information, allow to provide a subset of specific columns for insertion, make keep_alive configurable for web client
- Python client: Added Nothing type support for SQLAlchemy

Reliability changes:
- User-facing backward incompatible change: Previously, two features (isdeleted and `OPTIMIZE CLEANUP) under certain conditions could lead to corruption of the data in ClickHouse. To protect the integrity of the data of our users, while keeping the core of the functionality, we adjusted how this feature works. Specifically, the MergeTree setting cleandeletedrows is now deprecated and has no effect anymore. The CLEANUP keyword is not allowed by default (to use it you will need to enable allowexperimentalreplacingmergewithcleanup). If you decide to use CLEANUP, you need to make sure that it is always used together with FINAL, and you must guarantee that no rows with older versions will be inserted after you run OPTIMIZE FINAL CLEANUP`.</description>

      <link>https://clickhouse.com/docs/cloud/whats-new/cloud#november-3-2022</link>
      <description>General changes:

      <title>ClickHouse Cloud - October 25, 2022</title>
      <link>https://clickhouse.com/docs/cloud/whats-new/cloud#october-25-2022</link>
      <description>General changes:
- Reduced minimum service memory allocation to 24G
- Reduced service idle timeout from 30 minutes to 5 minutes

Configuration changes:
- Reduced maxpartsintotal from 100k to 10k. The default value of the maxpartsintotal setting for MergeTree tables has been lowered from 100,000 to 10,000. The reason for this change is that we observed that a large number of data parts is likely to cause a slow startup time of services in the cloud. A large number of parts usually indicates a choice of too granular partition key, which is typically done accidentally and should be avoided. The change of default will allow the detection of these cases earlier.

Console changes:
- Enhanced credit usage details in the Billing view for trial users
- Improved tooltips and help text, and added a link to the pricing page in the Usage view
- Improved workflow when switching options for IP filtering
- Added resend email confirmation button to the cloud console</description>
