# ClickHouse documentation writing guide

This is a work in progress, and probably will be for a while.  Please open an issue if there is something that you would like to see covered.

## Welcome, and thank you

Writing the docs is important, and we thank you for your help.  In this doc, you will find:

- instructions for building the ClickHouse docs
- suggestions to save you time, for example, ways to use reusable content
- ways to avoid 404s
- examples of techniques used throughout the ClickHouse docs

## Check the look of your documentation changes

There are a few options that are all useful depending on how large or complex your edits are.

### Use the GitHub web interface to edit

Every page in the docs has an **Edit this page** link that opens the page in the GitHub editor.  GitHub has Markdown support with a preview feature. The details of GitHub Markdown and the documentation Markdown are a bit different but generally this is close enough, and the person merging your PR will build the docs and check them.

### Install a Markdown editor or plugin for your IDE

Usually, these plugins provide a preview of how the markdown will render, and they catch basic errors like unclosed tags very early.

## Building the docs locally

You can build the ClickHouse docs on most machines.
Our build process is a little different because part of our docs are in the [ClickHouse](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/) repo, and the rest are in the ClickHouse/clickhouse-docs repo. Here is the process on macOS:

The documentation is built with Docusaurus, which requires Node.js. We recommend version 18. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

```bash
brew install npm
brew install yarn

mkdir docs
cd docs

git clone https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse
git clone https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse-docs

# Docusaurus expects all of the markdown files to be located in the directory tree clickhouse-docs/docs/.
# This is not the way our repos are set up, so some copying of files is needed to build the docs:
# Note: Symlinks will not work.
cp -r ClickHouse/docs/en/development     ClickHouse-docs/docs/en/
cp -r ClickHouse/docs/en/engines         ClickHouse-docs/docs/en/
cp -r ClickHouse/docs/en/getting-started ClickHouse-docs/docs/en/
cp -r ClickHouse/docs/en/interfaces      ClickHouse-docs/docs/en/
cp -r ClickHouse/docs/en/operations      ClickHouse-docs/docs/en/
cp -r ClickHouse/docs/en/sql-reference   ClickHouse-docs/docs/en/
cp -r ClickHouse/docs/ru                 ClickHouse-docs/docs/
cp -r ClickHouse/docs/zh                 ClickHouse-docs/docs/

cd ClickHouse-docs

# This command installs the Docusaurus packages and prerequisites in a subdirectory of `clickhouse-docs` named `node_modules`

yarn install

# This command will start Docusaurus in development mode, which means that as you edit source (for example, .md files)
# files the changes will be rendered into HTML files and served by the Docusaurus development server.

# Edit your files. Remember that if you are editing files in the ClickHouse/ClickHouse repo then you should edit them in
# that repo and then copy the edited file into the ClickHouse/clickhouse-docs/ directory structure so that they are updated
# in your develoment environment.

yarn start

# 'yarn start' probably opened a browser for you when you ran it; if not, open a browser to http://localhost:3000/docs/en/intro
# and navigate to the documentation that you are changing. If you have already made the changes, you can verify them here; if
# not, make them, and you will see the page update as you save the changes.
```


## 404s :(

### Relative links without the file extension (`.md` or `.mdx`)
We have seen more and more 404s as the size of the docs grow.
It seems that these are related to the use of `../` in the path to the markdown files.  Please write links to other doc
pages as:

#### link to another doc
```md title="foo"
[async_insert](/docs/en/operations/settings/settings.md)
```

#### link to an anchor within another doc

```md
[async_insert](/docs/en/operations/settings/settings.md/#async-insert)
```

Note the initial `/`, the `.md` and the slash between the `.md` and the `#async-insert` in the second example.

### Avoid absolute URLs when linking within the docs

Absolute URLs, those starting with `http` are not verified
by Docusaurus.  If you are linking within the docs, then use
a relative URL and use the path on disk.  For example:

```
https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/install/
```

should be replaced with

```md
/docs/en/getting-started/install.md
```

If you look closely, the path on disk does not match the URL.  The URLs can be changed by setting the `slug` in the markdown file frontmatter.

## Introduce your topic
The default first page in a folder (category in Docusaurus terminology) is a list of the pages in that folder.  If you would like an intro or overview page, then add that page to `docs/en/coverpages/`.  This example is addring an Architecture folder, so the full filename would be `docs/en/coverpages/architecture.md`

The next step depends on the location of the file in the nav.  In this example, architecture is at the root level:

### Root folders
If your folder is at the root level of the nav, then the cover page is specified in `sidebards.js`:
```js
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Architecture',
        link: {
          type: 'doc',
          id: 'en/coverpages/architecture',
          },
         collapsed: true, 
         items: [
           {    
             type: 'autogenerated',
              dirName: 'en/architecture',
           },
         ],
    }, 
```

### Deeper folders
If your folder is deeper, then add a :wfile to your folder named `_category_.yml` with contents silimar to this:
```yml
TBD
```

## Save time with reusable content
Many of the pages in the docs have a section toward the top about gathering the connection details for your ClickHouse service.  Sending people off to look at a page to learn about the connection details and then having them forget what they were doing is a poor user experience.  If you can just include the right instructions in the current doc, please do so.  In general there are two interfaces that people will use when integrating some 3rd party software, or even `clickhouse client` to ClickHouse:

- HTTPS
- Native TCP

If you are writing about some language client or visualization tool, or ELT tool and it needs to connect to an HTTPS port then this line imports the content:
```jsx
import ConnectionDetails from '@site/docs/en/_snippets/_gather_your_details_http.mdx';
```

and this will render it:
```jsx
## 1. Gather your connection details
<ConnectionDetails />
```

Note: in the preceding code block, a level two header is used; change it to whatever makes sense in your doc.

There are other snippets in `/docs/en/_snippets` for you to use.  If you need to repeat something, consider adding a new snippet or opening an issue for one to be added.

Here is how the above renders:

![sample connection info](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-docs/main/images/snippet-example.png)

## Avoid sending readers in circles

### Links can be overdone
Every time you mention a feature or product you may be tempted to link to it.  Don't do it.  When peole see links
they can be tempted to visit them, and quite often there is no need for them to go to the linked content.  If you mention a technique and you need the reader to learn it right then, add a link.  If they should read about it later then add a link down at the bottom of the doc in a **What's next** section.

### Include content in the current doc instead
If you find yourself wanting to send the reader to another doc to perform a task before they perform the main task that you are writing about, then maybe that prerequisite task should be included in the current doc instead so the reader is not clicking back and forth.  It may be time to create a snippet pull the content from the other doc into a snippet file and include it in the current doc and the other doc that you pulled it from (see [above](#save-time-with-reusable-content)).

## Avoid multiple pages for a single topic

Some docs contain information for both Cloud and Self-managed ClickHouse, and some contain client side information for Linux and macOS (and recently Windows WSL).  When possible identify the differences and use tabs for the areas of the doc which vary.

Note: in the examples below you may notice that the H1 and H2 headers are outside of the tabs, the right-side "What's on this page" nav is built from the H1,2,3 headers in the main body of the markdown file, headings within the tabs are not currently included.

### Differences between Cloud and Self-managed

Backup and restore are very different across Cloud and Self-managed as the target for the backup does not need to be specified, etc.  The backup docs are an example where there is no content reused, so everything goes into one tab or the other. This is how the tabs are constructed:

```md
---
sidebar_label: Backups
sidebar_position: 1
slug: /en/manage/backups
---

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

# Backups

<Tabs groupId="deployMethod">
<TabItem value="serverless" label="ClickHouse Cloud" default>

Cloud specific content here

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="selfmanaged" label="Self-managed">

Self-managed specific content here

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
### Differences across operating systems

Sometimes most of the content is the same across operating systems.  For example, in the **clickhouse-client and clickhouse-local** docs the introductory information and the next steps are common, and only the install commands are different:

```md
---
slug: /en/integrations/sql-clients/clickhouse-client-local
sidebar_label: clickhouse-client
title: clickhouse-client and clickhouse-local
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

# clickhouse-client and clickhouse-local

Common information

:::tip
If you have already installed ClickHouse server locally you may have **clickhouse-client** and **clickhouse local** installed.  Check by running **clickhouse client** and **clickhouse local** at the commandline.  Otherwise follow the instructions for your operating system.
:::

## Install clickhouse-client and clickhouse-local

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

#### Install the clickhouse-client package:

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

#### Download ClickHouse:

We do not provide an installer for macOS.  Download the binary build for your architecture (x86_64 or Apple Silicon).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="wsl" label="Microsoft Windows with WSL 2">

In Microsoft Windows 10 or 11 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) version 2 (WSL 2) you can run Ubuntu Linux, and then install `clickhouse-client` and `clickhouse-local` by following the Debian install instructions.

### Generating release notes

Release notes are generated with Python.  This requires a GitHub user token, which you can export in your environment or pass on the commandline.
```bash
cd ClickHouse/utils/changelog
git fetch --all
export GHTOKEN="<your token>"
python3.9 changelog.py  --gh-user-or-token=$GHTOKEN  HEAD > /tmp/cl.md
```

### Run unreleased builds on your system
When writing docs about a new feature it helps to be able to use the new feature before there is an official release.  The easiest way to get the latest build is:
```bash
curl https://ClickHouse.com/ | sh
```

### Run unreleased builds in Docker

```bash
docker pull clickhouse/clickhouse-server:head
```

```bash
docker run -d \
	--cap-add=SYS_NICE \
    --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
    --cap-add=IPC_LOCK \
	--name some-clickhouse-server \
    --ulimit nofile=262144:262144 \
    clickhouse/clickhouse-server:head
```

## Tests: A great source of details

If you want to run the tests from the `ClickHouse/tests` directory you either need a full release, a CI build, or to compile yourself. [How to get the binaries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/development/build/#you-dont-have-to-build-clickhouse)

### Extracting build from RPMs

If you want to extract the binary files from RPMs to use with the test `runner`, you can use `cpio`

```bash
mkdir 22.12
mv cl*rpm 22.12/
export CHDIR=`pwd`/22.12
cd $CHDIR
rpm2cpio ./clickhouse-server-22.12.1.1738.x86_64.rpm | \
  cpio -id --no-absolute-filenames

rpm2cpio ./clickhouse-client-22.12.1.1738.x86_64.rpm | \
    cpio -id --no-absolute-filenames

rpm2cpio ./clickhouse-common-static-22.12.1.1738.x86_64.rpm | \
  cpio -id --no-absolute-filenames
```

### Modify the ClickHouse server config

If you are running the ClickHouse server process and not using the standard
directories of `/etc/clickhouse-server` for configs and `/var` for the data directories
then you will need to edit the config.

Create an override dir:
```bash
mkdir $CHDIR/etc/clickhouse-server/config.d
```

This is a sample `$CHDIR/etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/dirs.xml`
file that overrides the default config:

```xml
<clickhouse>
    <logger>
        <level>error</level>
        <log>/home/droscigno/Downloads/22.12/usr/var/log/clickhouse-server/clickhouse-server.log</log>
        <errorlog>/home/droscigno/Downloads/22.12/usr/var/log/clickhouse-server/clickhouse-server.err.log</errorlog>
    </logger>
    <path>/home/droscigno/Downloads/22.12/usr/var/lib/clickhouse/</path>
    <tmp_path>/home/droscigno/Downloads/22.12/usr/var/lib/clickhouse/tmp/</tmp_path>
    <user_files_path>/home/droscigno/Downloads/22.12/usr/var/lib/clickhouse/user_files/</user_files_path>
    <user_directories>
        <local_directory>
            <path>/home/droscigno/Downloads/22.12/usr/var/lib/clickhouse/access/</path>
        </local_directory>
    </user_directories>
    <format_schema_path>/home/droscigno/Downloads/22.12/usr/var/lib/clickhouse/format_schemas/</format_schema_path>
</clickhouse>
```
### Run ClickHouse

From $CHDIR/usr/bin:

```bash
./clickhouse-server -C ../../etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml
```

### Command to run tests:

These examples use env vars for the directory names:

- $DOCS is the parent directory of the ClickHouse repo
- $CHDIR is the parent directory of the extracted ClickHouse download files

For SQL tests:

The command to run the tests needs:

- The $PATH to use, with $CHDIR/usr/bin added to the $PATH
- The path to `clickhouse-test`
- The name of the test to run

For example, to run the test `01428_hash_set_nan_key`:
```bash
PATH=$CHDIR/usr/bin/:$PATH \
  $DOCS/ClickHouse/tests/clickhouse-test \
  01428_hash_set_nan_key
```

To see the queries that were run:
```bash
PATH=$CHDIR/usr/bin/$PATH \
clickhouse-client -q \
"select query from system.query_log ORDER BY event_time FORMAT Vertical"
```

For integration tests:
```bash
cd $DOCS/ClickHouse/tests/integration/
./runner -n 5 \
  --src-dir $DOCS/ClickHouse/src \
  --binary $CHDIR/usr/bin/clickhouse-server \
  --cleanup-containers \
  --command bash
```

## How to change code highlighting?

Code highlighting is based on the language chosen for your code blocks.  Specify the language when you start the code block:

<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>```sql
SELECT firstname from imdb.actors;
```
</code></pre>

```sql
SELECT firstname from imdb.actors;
```

If you need a language supported then open an issue in [ClickHouse-docs](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-docs/issues).

## How to subscribe on documentation changes?

At the moment there’s no easy way to do just that, but you can consider:

-   To hit the “Watch” button on top of GitHub web interface to know as early as possible, even during pull request. Alternative to this is `#github-activity` channel of [public ClickHouse Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/clickhousedb/shared_invite/zt-qfort0u8-TWqK4wIP0YSdoDE0btKa1w).
-   Some search engines allow to subscribe on specific website changes via email and you can opt-in for that for https://clickhouse.com.

### Doc search tweaks
We use [Docsearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) from Algolia; there is not much for you to do to have the docs you write added to the search.  Every Monday, the Algolia crawler updates our index.

If a search is not finding the page that you expect, then have a look at the Markdown for that page.  For example, a search for `UDF` was returning a bunch of changelog entries, but not the page specifically for user defined functions.  This was the Markdown for the page:

```md
---
slug: /en/sql-reference/statements/create/function
sidebar_position: 38
sidebar_label: FUNCTION
---

# CREATE FUNCTION

Creates a user defined function from a lambda expression.
```

And this was the change to improve the search results (add the expected search terms to the H1 heading):

```md
---
slug: /en/sql-reference/statements/create/function
sidebar_position: 38
sidebar_label: FUNCTION
---

# CREATE FUNCTION &mdash; user defined function (UDF)

Creates a user defined function from a lambda expression.
```

Note: The docs are crawled each Monday morning.  If you make a change and want the docs re-crawled open an issue in clickhouse-docs.
