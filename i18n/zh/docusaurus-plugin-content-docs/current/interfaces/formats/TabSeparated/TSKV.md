## 描述 \{#description\}

类似于 [`TabSeparated`](./TabSeparated.md) 格式，但以 `name=value` 格式输出值。
名称的转义方式与 [`TabSeparated`](./TabSeparated.md) 格式相同，且 `=` 符号也会被转义。

```text
SearchPhrase=   count()=8267016
SearchPhrase=bathroom interior design    count()=2166
SearchPhrase=clickhouse     count()=1655
SearchPhrase=2014 spring fashion    count()=1549
SearchPhrase=freeform photos       count()=1480
SearchPhrase=angelina jolie    count()=1245
SearchPhrase=omsk       count()=1112
SearchPhrase=photos of dog breeds    count()=1091
SearchPhrase=curtain designs        count()=1064
SearchPhrase=baku       count()=1000
```

```sql title="Query"
SELECT * FROM t_null FORMAT TSKV
```

```text title="Response"
x=1    y=\N
```

:::note
当存在大量列且每列数据量较小时，此格式效率低下，一般没有使用它的理由。
不过，就效率而言，它并不比 [`JSONEachRow`](../JSON/JSONEachRow.md) 格式更差。
:::

在解析时，不同列取值的顺序可以是任意的。
允许省略某些值，此时这些值将被视为其默认值。
在这种情况下，默认值为零和空字符串。
不能将本可以在表中指定的复杂值用作默认值。

在解析过程中，允许添加一个额外字段 `tskv`，该字段不带等号或值。该字段会被忽略。

在导入时，如果将设置 [`input_format_skip_unknown_fields`](/operations/settings/settings-formats.md/#input_format_skip_unknown_fields) 设为 `1`，则具有未知名称的列将被跳过。

[NULL](/sql-reference/syntax.md) 会被格式化为 `\N`。

## 示例用法 \{#example-usage\}

### 插入数据 \{#inserting-data\}

使用以下名为 `football.tskv` 的 tskv 文件：

插入数据：

```sql
INSERT INTO football FROM INFILE 'football.tskv' FORMAT TSKV;
```

### 读取数据 \{#reading-data\}

以 `TSKV` 格式读取数据：

```sql
SELECT *
FROM football
FORMAT TSKV
```

输出将采用制表符分隔格式，并包含两行表头：第一行为列名，第二行为列类型：
