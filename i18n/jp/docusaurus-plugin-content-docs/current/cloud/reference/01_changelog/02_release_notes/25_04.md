## Backward incompatible changes {#backward-incompatible-changes}

* Parquet output format converts Date and DateTime columns to date/time types supported by Parquet, instead of writing them as raw numbers. DateTime becomes DateTime64(3) (was: UInt32); setting `output_format_parquet_datetime_as_uint32` brings back the old behavior. Date becomes Date32 (was: UInt16). [#70950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70950) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Don't allow comparable types (like JSON/Object/AggregateFunction) in ORDER BY and comparison functions `less/greater/equal/etc` by default. [#73276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73276) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* `JSONEachRowWithProgress` will write the progress whenever the progress happens. In previous versions, the progress was shown only after each block of the result, which made it useless. Change the way how the progress is displayed: it will not show zero values. Keep in mind that the progress is sent even if it happens frequently. It can generate a significant volume of traffic. Keep in mind that the progress is not flushed when the output is compressed. This closes [#70800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70800). [#73834](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73834) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `mysql` dictionary source no longer does `SHOW TABLE STATUS` query, because it does not provide any value for InnoDB tables, as long as for any recent MySQL versions. This closes [#72636](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72636). This change is backward compatible, but put in this category, so you have a chance to notice it. [#73914](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73914) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `Merge` tables will unify the structure of underlying tables by using a union of their columns and deriving common types. This closes [#64864](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64864). This closes [#35307](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/35307). In certain cases, this change could be backward incompatible. One example is when there is no common type between tables, but conversion to the type of the first table is still possible, such as in the case of UInt64 and Int64 or any numeric type and String. If you want to return to the old behavior, set `merge_table_max_tables_to_look_for_schema_inference` to `1` or set `compatibility` to `24.12` or earlier. [#73956](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73956) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `CHECK TABLE` queries now require a separate, `CHECK` grant. In previous versions, it was enough to have `SHOW TABLES` grant to run these queries. But a `CHECK TABLE` query can be heavy, and usual query complexity limits for `SELECT` queries don't apply to it. It led to the potential of DoS. [#74471](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74471) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Check all columns in a materialized view match the target table if `allow_materialized_view_with_bad_select` is `false`. [#74481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74481) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Function `h3ToGeo()` now returns the results in the order `(lat, lon)` (which is the standard order for geometric functions). Users who wish to retain the legacy result order `(lon, lat)` can set setting `h3togeo_lon_lat_result_order = true`. [#74719](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74719) ([Manish Gill](https://github.com/mgill25)).
* Add `JSONCompactEachRowWithProgress` and `JSONCompactStringsEachRowWithProgress` formats. Continuation of [#69989](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69989). The `JSONCompactWithNames` and `JSONCompactWithNamesAndTypes` no longer output "totals" - apparently, it was a mistake in the implementation. [#75037](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75037) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Change `format_alter_operations_with_parentheses` default to true to make alter commands list unambiguous (see https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59532). This breaks replication with clusters prior to 24.3. If you are upgrading a cluster using older releases, turn off the setting in the server config or upgrade to 24.3 first. [#75302](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75302) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Disallow truncate database for replicated databases. [#76651](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76651) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Disable parallel replicas by default when analyzer is disabled regardless `compatibility` setting. It's still possible to change this behavior by explicitly setting `parallel_replicas_only_with_analyzer` to `false`. [#77115](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77115) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* It's no longer possible to use `NaN` or `inf` for float values as settings. [#77546](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77546) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Fixes cases where `dateTrunc` is used with negative date/datetime arguments. [#77622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77622) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* The legacy MongoDB integration has been removed. Server setting `use_legacy_mongodb_integration` became obsolete and now does nothing. [#77895](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77895) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Enhance SummingMergeTree validation to skip aggregation for columns used in partition or sort keys. [#78022](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78022) ([Pervakov Grigorii](https://github.com/GrigoryPervakov)).

## New features {#new-features}

* Added an in-memory cache for deserialized skipping index granules. This should make repeated queries that use skipping indexes faster. The size of the new cache is controlled by server settings `skipping_index_cache_size` and `skipping_index_cache_max_entries`. The original motivation for the cache were vector similarity indexes which became a lot faster now. [#70102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70102) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* A new implementation of the Userspace Page Cache, which allows caching data in the in-process memory instead of relying on the OS page cache. It is useful when the data is stored on a remote virtual filesystem without backing with the local filesystem cache. [#70509](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70509) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Add setting to query Iceberg tables as of a specific timestamp. [#71072](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71072) ([Brett Hoerner](https://github.com/bretthoerner)).
* Implement Iceberg tables partition pruning for time-related transform partition operations in Iceberg. [#72044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72044) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Add the ability to create min-max (skipping) indices by default for columns managed by MergeTree using settings `enable_minmax_index_for_all_numeric_columns` (for numeric columns) and `enable_minmax_index_for_all_string_columns` (for string columns). For now, both settings are disabled, so there is no behavior change yet. [#72090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72090) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Added aggregation function sequenceMatchEvents which return timestamps of matched events for longest chain of events in pattern. [#72349](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72349) ([UnamedRus](https://github.com/UnamedRus)).
* `SELECT` and `VIEW` statements now support aliases, e.g. `SELECT b FROM (SELECT number, number*2 FROM numbers(2)) AS x (a, b);`. This enables TPC-H query 15 to run without modifications. [#72480](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72480) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Added a new setting `enable_adaptive_memory_spill_scheduler` that allows multiple grace JOINs in the same query to monitor their combined memory footprint and trigger spilling into an external storage adaptively to prevent MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED. [#72728](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72728) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Added function `arrayNormalizedGini`. [#72823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72823) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Support low cardinality decimal data types, fix [#72256](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72256). [#72833](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72833) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
* When `min_age_to_force_merge_seconds` and `min_age_to_force_merge_on_partition_only` are both enabled, the part merging will ignore the max bytes limit. [#73656](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73656) ([Kai Zhu](https://github.com/nauu)).
* Support reading HALF_FLOAT values from Apache Arrow/Parquet/ORC (they are read into Float32). This closes [#72960](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72960). Keep in mind that IEEE-754 half float is not the same as BFloat16. Closes [#73835](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73835). [#73836](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73836) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `system.trace_log` table will contain two new columns, `symbols` and `lines` containing symbolized stack trace. It allows for easy collection and export of profile information. This is controlled by the server configuration value `symbolize` inside `trace_log` and is enabled by default. [#73896](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73896) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a new function, `generateSerialID`, which can be used to generate auto-incremental numbers in tables. Continuation of [#64310](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64310) by [kazalika](https://github.com/kazalika). This closes [#62485](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/62485). [#73950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73950) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add syntax `query1 PARALLEL WITH query2 PARALLEL WITH query3 ... PARALLEL WITH queryN` That means subqueries `{query1, query2, ... queryN}` are allowed to run in parallel with each other (and it's preferable). [#73983](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73983) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Now, Play UI has a progress bar during query runtime. It allows cancelling queries. It displays the total number of records and the extended information about the speed. The table can be rendered incrementally as soon as data arrives. Enable HTTP compression. Rendering of the table became faster. The table header became sticky. It allows selecting cells and navigating them by arrow keys. Fix the issue when the outline of the selected cell makes it smaller. Cells no longer expand on mouse hover but only on selection. The moment to stop rendering the incoming data is decided on the client rather than on the server side. Highlight digit groups for numbers. The overall design was refreshed and became bolder. It checks if the server is reachable and the correctness of credentials and displays the server version and uptime. The cloud icon is contoured in every font, even in Safari. Big integers inside nested data types will be rendered better. It will display inf/nan correctly. It will display data types when the mouse is over a column header. [#74204](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74204) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add the ability to create min-max (skipping) indices by default for columns managed by MergeTree using settings `add_minmax_index_for_numeric_columns` (for numeric columns) and `add_minmax_index_for_string_columns` (for string columns). For now, both settings are disabled, so there is no behavior change yet. [#74266](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74266) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add `script_query_number` and `script_line_number` fields to `system.query_log`, to the ClientInfo in the native protocol, and to server logs. This closes [#67542](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/67542). Credits to [pinsvin00](https://github.com/pinsvin00) for kicking off this feature earlier in [#68133](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68133). [#74477](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74477) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add minus operator support for DateTime64, to allow subtraction between DateTime64 values, as well as DateTime. [#74482](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74482) ([Li Yin](https://github.com/liyinsg)).
* Support DeltaLake table engine for AzureBlobStorage. Fixes [#68043](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68043). [#74541](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74541) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add bind_host setting to set the source IP address for clickhouse client connections. [#74741](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74741) ([Todd Yocum](https://github.com/toddyocum)).
* Added an ability to apply non-finished (not materialized by background process) mutations during the execution of `SELECT` queries immediately after submitting. It can be enabled by setting `apply_mutations_on_fly`. [#74877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74877) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fixed some previously unexpected cases when `toStartOfInterval` datetime arguments are negative. Done by implementing a new function called toStartOfIntervalAllowNegative, which does pretty much the same but returns only Date32/DateTime64. [#74933](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74933) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* A new function initialQueryStartTime has been added. It returns the start time of the current query. The value is the same across all shards during a distributed query. [#75087](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75087) ([Roman Lomonosov](https://github.com/lomik)).
* Introduce parametrized_view_parameters in system.tables. Closes https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/issues/66756. [#75112](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75112) ([NamNguyenHoai](https://github.com/NamHoaiNguyen)).
* Allow altering a database comment. Closes [#73351](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73351) ### Documentation entry for user-facing changes. [#75622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75622) ([NamNguyenHoai](https://github.com/NamHoaiNguyen)).
* Add ability to ATTACH tables without database layer (avoids UUID hack). [#75788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75788) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added `concurrent_threads_scheduler` server setting that governs how CPU slots are distributed among concurrent queries. Could be set to `round_robin` (previous behavior) or `fair_round_robin` to address the issue of unfair CPU distribution between INSERTs and SELECTs. [#75949](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75949) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Restore QPL codec which has been removed in v24.10 due to licensing issues. [#76021](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76021) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Added function `arraySymmetricDifference`. It returns all elements from multiple array arguments which do not occur in all arguments. Example: `SELECT arraySymmetricDifference([1, 2], [2, 3])` returns `[1, 3]`. (issue [#61673](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/61673)). [#76231](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76231) ([Filipp Abapolov](https://github.com/pheepa)).
* Add `estimatecompressionratio` aggregate function- see [#70801](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70801). [#76661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76661) ([Tariq Almawash](https://github.com/talmawash)).
* `FilterTransformPassedRows` and `FilterTransformPassedBytes` profile events will show the number of rows and number of bytes filtered during the query execution. [#76662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76662) ([Onkar Deshpande](https://github.com/onkar)).
* Added the keccak256 hash function, commonly used in blockchain implementations, especially in EVM-based systems. [#76669](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76669) ([Arnaud Briche](https://github.com/arnaudbriche)).
* Scram SHA256 & update postgres wire auth. [#76839](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76839) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* The functionality adds the ability to define a list of headers that are forwarded from the headers of the client request to the external http authenticator. [#77054](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77054) ([inv2004](https://github.com/inv2004)).
* Support `IcebergMetadataFilesCache`, which will store manifest files/list and metadata.json in one cache. [#77156](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77156) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* Add functions `arrayLevenshteinDistance`, `arrayLevenshteinDistanceWeighted`, and `arraySimilarity`. [#77187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77187) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Add three new functions. `icebergTruncate` according to specification. https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#truncate-transform-details, `toYearNumSinceEpoch` and `toMonthNumSinceEpoch`. Support `truncate` transform in partition pruning for `Iceberg` engine. [#77403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77403) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Allows a user to query the state of an Iceberg table as it existed at a previous point in time. [#77439](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77439) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Added CPU slot scheduling for workloads, see https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/workload-scheduling#cpu_scheduling for details. [#77595](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77595) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* The `hasAll()` function can now take advantage of the tokenbf_v1, ngrambf_v1 full-text skipping indices. [#77662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77662) ([UnamedRus](https://github.com/UnamedRus)).
* `JSON` data type is production-ready. See https://jsonbench.com/. `Dynamic` and `Varaint` data types are production ready. [#77785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77785) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added an in-memory cache for deserialized vector similarity indexes. This should make repeated approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search queries faster. The size of the new cache is controlled by server settings `vector_similarity_index_cache_size` and `vector_similarity_index_cache_max_entries`. This feature supersedes the skipping index cache feature of earlier releases. [#77905](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77905) ([Shankar Iyer](https://github.com/shankar-iyer)).
* Functions sparseGrams and sparseGramsHashes with UTF8 versions added. Author: [scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12). [#78176](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78176) ([Pervakov Grigorii](https://github.com/GrigoryPervakov)).
* Introduce `toInterval` function. This function accepts 2 arguments (value and unit), and converts the value to a specific `Interval` type. [#78723](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78723) ([Andrew Davis](https://github.com/pulpdrew)).

## Experimental features {#experimental-features}

* Allow automatic cleanup merges of entire partitions after a configurable timeout with a new setting `enable_replacing_merge_with_cleanup_for_min_age_to_force_merge`. [#76440](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76440) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Add support [for Unity Catalog](https://www.databricks.com/product/unity-catalog) for DeltaLake tables on top of AWS S3 and local filesystem. [#76988](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76988) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Introduce experimental integration with AWS Glue service catalog for Iceberg tables. [#77257](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77257) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

## Performance improvements {#performance-improvements}

* Apply `preserve_most` attribute at some places in code. [#67778](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67778) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Implement query condition cache to improve query performance using repeated conditions. The range of the portion of data that does not meet the condition is remembered as a temporary index in memory. Subsequent queries will use this index. close [#67768](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/67768) ### Documentation entry for user-facing changes. [#69236](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69236) ([zhongyuankai](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* Support async io prefetch for `NativeORCBlockInputFormat`, which improves overall performance by hiding remote io latency. Speedup ratio could reach 1.47x in my test case. [#70534](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70534) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improve grace hash join performance by rerange the right join table by keys. [#72237](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72237) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Reintroduce respect `ttl_only_drop_parts` on `materialize ttl`; only read the necessary columns to recalculate TTL and drop parts by replacing them with an empty one. [#72751](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72751) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Allow `arrayROCAUC` and `arrayAUCPR` to compute partial area of the whole curve, so that its calculation can be parallelized over huge datasets. [#72904](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72904) ([Emmanuel](https://github.com/emmanuelsdias)).
* Avoid spawn too many idle threads. [#72920](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72920) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).
* Splitting of left table blocks by hash was removed from the probe phase of the `parallel_hash` JOIN algorithm. [#73089](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73089) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Don't list blob storage keys if we only have curly brackets expansion in table function. Closes [#73333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73333). [#73518](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73518) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Replace Int256 and UInt256 with clang builtin i256 in arithmetic calculation according to tests in [#70502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70502). [#73658](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73658) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Adds a fast path for functions with all argument types is numeric. Fix performance issues in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72258. [#73820](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73820) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Do not apply `maskedExecute` on non-function columns, improve the performance of short circuit execution. [#73965](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73965) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Disable header detection for Kafka/NATS/RabbitMQ/FileLog to improve performance. [#74006](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74006) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Use log wrappers by value and don't allocate them in a heap. [#74034](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74034) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
* Execute a pipeline with a higher degree of parallelism after aggregation with grouping sets. [#74082](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74082) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Reduce critical section in `MergeTreeReadPool`. [#74202](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74202) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).
* Optimized function `indexHint`. Now, columns that are only used as arguments of function `indexHint` are not read from the table. [#74314](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74314) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Parallel replicas performance improvement. Packets deserialization on query initiator, for packets not related to parallel replicas protocol, now always happens in pipeline thread. Before, it could happen in a thread responsible for pipeline scheduling, which could make initiator less responsive and delay pipeline execution. [#74398](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74398) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Fixed calculation of size in memory for `LowCardinality` columns. [#74688](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74688) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Improves the performance of whole JSON column reading in Wide parts from S3. It's done by adding prefetches for sub column prefixes deserialization, cache of deserialized prefixes and parallel deserialization of subcolumn prefixes. It improves reading of the JSON column from S3 4 times in query like `SELECT data FROM table` and about 10 times in query like `SELECT data FROM table LIMIT 10`. [#74827](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74827) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Preallocate memory used by async inserts to improve performance. [#74945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74945) ([Ilya Golshtein](https://github.com/ilejn)).
* Fixed double pre-allocation in `ConcurrentHashJoin` in case join sides are swapped by the optimizer. [#75149](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75149) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Fixed unnecessary contention in `parallel_hash` when `max_rows_in_join = max_bytes_in_join = 0`. [#75155](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75155) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Slight improvement in some join scenarios: precalculate number of output rows and reserve memory for them. [#75376](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75376) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* `plain_rewritable` metadata files are small and do not need a large default buffer. Use a write buffer sized appropriately to fit the given path, improving memory utilization for a large number of active parts. ### Documentation entry for user-facing changes. [#75758](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75758) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* In some cases (e.g., empty array column) data parts can contain empty files. We can skip writing empty blobs to ObjectStorage and only store metadata for such files when the table resides on disk with separated metadata and object storages. [#75860](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75860) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* It was discovered that concurrency control could lead to unfair CPU distribution between INSERTs and SELECTs. When all CPU slots are allocated unconditionally (w/o competition) to INSERTs with `max_threads` = 1 while SELECTs with high `max_threads` values suffer from poor performance due to using only a single thread. [#75941](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75941) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Trivial opt on wrapInNullable to avoid unnecessary null map allocation. [#76489](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76489) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Improve min/max performance for Decimal32/Decimal64/DateTime64. [#76570](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76570) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Actively evict data from the cache on parts removal. Do not let the cache grow to the maximum size if the amount of data is less. [#76641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76641) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Query compilation (setting `compile_expressions`) now considers the machine type. This speeds up such queries significantly. [#76753](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76753) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Optimize arraySort. [#76850](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76850) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Speed-up building JOIN result by de-virtualizing calls to `col->insertFrom()`. [#77350](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77350) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* Merge marks of the same part and write them to the query condition cache at one time to reduce the consumption of locks. [#77377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77377) ([zhongyuankai](https://github.com/zhongyuankai)).
* Optimize order by single nullable or low-cardinality columns. [#77789](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77789) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Disable `filesystem_cache_prefer_bigger_buffer_size` when the cache is used passively, such as for merges. [#77898](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77898) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Implement trivial count optimization for Iceberg. Now queries with `count()` and without any filters should be faster. Closes [#77639](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/77639). [#78090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78090) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Support Iceberg data pruning based on lower_bound and uppert_bound values for columns. Fixes [#77638](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/77638). [#78242](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78242) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Optimize memory usage for NativeReader. [#78442](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78442) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Trivial optimization: do not rewrite `count(if())` to countIf if `CAST` is required. Close [#78564](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/78564). [#78565](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78565) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).

## Improvements {#improvements}

* Decrease the amount of Keeper requests by eliminating the use of single `get` requests, which could have caused a significant load on Keeper with the increased number of replicas, in places where `multiRead` is available. [#56862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/56862) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Add support for SSL authentication with named collections for MySQL. Closes [#59111](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59111). [#59452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59452) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Improve new analyzer infrastructure performance via storing `ColumnPtr` instead of `Field` in the `ConstantNode`. Related to [#62245](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/62245). [#63198](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63198) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Reject queries when the server is overloaded. The decision is made based on the ratio of wait time (`OSCPUWaitMicroseconds`) to busy time (`OSCPUVirtualTimeMicroseconds`). The query is dropped with some probability, when this ratio is between `min_os_cpu_wait_time_ratio_to_throw` and `max_os_cpu_wait_time_ratio_to_throw` (those are query level settings). [#63206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63206) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Drop blocks as early as possible to reduce the memory requirements. [#65647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65647) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* `processors_profile_log` table now has default configuration with TTL of 30 days. [#66139](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66139) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Allow creating of a `bloom_filter` index on columns with datatype DateTime64. [#66416](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66416) ([Yutong Xiao](https://github.com/YutSean)).
* Introduce latency buckets and use them to track first byte read/write and connect times for S3 requests. That way we can later use gathered data to calculate approximate percentiles and adapt timeouts. [#69783](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69783) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Queries passed to `Executable` storage are no longer limited to single threaded execution. [#70084](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70084) ([yawnt](https://github.com/yawnt)).
* Added HTTP headers to OpenTelemetry span logs table for enhanced traceability. [#70516](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70516) ([jonymohajanGmail](https://github.com/jonymohajanGmail)).
* Support writing of orc files by custom time zone, not always by `GMT` time zone. [#70615](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70615) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Replace table functions with their `-Cluster` alternatives if parallel replicas are enabled. Fixes [#65024](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65024). [#70659](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70659) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Respect IO scheduling settings when writing backups across clouds. [#71093](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71093) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Reestablish connection to MySQL and Postgres dictionary replicas in the background so it wouldn't delay requests to corresponding dictionaries. [#71101](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71101) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Add metric alias name to system.asynchronous_metrics. [#71164](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71164) ([megao](https://github.com/jetgm)).
* Refreshes of refreshable materialized views now appear in `system.query_log`. [#71333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71333) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Evaluate parquet bloom filters and min/max indexes together. Necessary to properly support: `x = 3 or x > 5` where data = [1, 2, 4, 5]. [#71383](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71383) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Interactive metrics improvements. Fix metrics from parallel replicas not being fully displayed. Display the metrics in order of the most recent update, then lexicographically by name. Do not display stale metrics. [#71631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71631) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Historically for some reason, the query `ALTER TABLE MOVE PARTITION TO TABLE` checked `SELECT` and `ALTER DELETE` rights instead of dedicated `ALTER_MOVE_PARTITION`. This PR makes use of this access type. For compatibility, this permission is also will be granted implicitly if `SELECT` and `ALTER DELETE` are granted, but this behavior will be removed in future releases. Closes [#16403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16403). [#71632](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71632) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Enables setting `use_hive_partitioning` by default. [#71636](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71636) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Throw an exception when trying to materialize a column in the sort key instead of allowing it to break the sort order. Does not solve [#71777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71777), though. [#71891](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71891) ([Peter Nguyen](https://github.com/petern48)).
* Allow more general join planning algorithm when hash join algorithm is enabled. [#71926](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71926) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Hide secrets in `EXPLAIN QUERY TREE`. [#72025](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72025) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Allow use of a configurable disk to store metadata files of databases and tables. The disk name can be set via `database_disk.disk` config parameter. [#72027](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72027) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* Support parquet integer logical types on native reader. [#72105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72105) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Make JSON output format pretty by default. Add new setting `output_format_json_pretty_print` to control it and enable it by default. [#72148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72148) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Interactively request credentials in the browser if the default user requires a password. In previous versions, the server returned HTTP 403; now, it returns HTTP 401. [#72198](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72198) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* This PR converts access types `CREATE_USER`, `ALTER_USER`, `DROP_USER`, `CREATE_ROLE`, `ALTER_ROLE`, `DROP_ROLE` from global to parameterized. That means users can now grant access management grants more precise:. [#72246](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72246) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Allow to shard names in cluster configuration. [#72276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72276) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* Support CAST and ALTER between JSON types with different parameters. [#72303](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72303) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add the `latest_fail_error_code_name` column to `system.mutations`. We need this column to introduce a new metric on stuck mutations and use it to build graphs of the errors encountered in the cloud as well as, optionally, adding a new less-noisy alert. [#72398](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72398) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Reduce the amount of allocation in attaching of partitions. [#72583](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72583) ([Konstantin Morozov](https://github.com/k-morozov)).
* Make max_bytes_before_external_sort limit depends on total query memory consumption (previously it was number of bytes in the sorting block for one sorting thread, now it has the same meaning as `max_bytes_before_external_group_by` - it is total limit for the whole query memory for all threads). Also one more setting added to control on disk block size - `min_external_sort_block_bytes`. [#72598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72598) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

* Adds setting `max_backup_bandwidth` to the list of settings that can be specified as part of `BACKUP`/`RESTORE` queries. [#72665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72665) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Parallel replicas used historical information about replica availability to improve replica selection but did not update the replica's error count when the connection was unavailable. This PR updates the replica's error count when unavailable. [#72666](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72666) ([zoomxi](https://github.com/zoomxi)).
* Reducing the log level for appearing replicated parts in the ReplicatedMergeTree engine to help minimize the volume of logs generated in a replicated cluster. [#72876](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72876) ([mor-akamai](https://github.com/morkalfon)).
* A lot of new features will require better code incapsulation (what relates to Iceberg metadata) and better code abstractions. [#72941](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72941) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).

* Write parts with level 1 if `optimize_on_insert` is enabled. It allows to use several optimizations of queries with `FINAL` for freshly written parts. [#73132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73132) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* For a query like, `WHERE a<b AND b<c AND c<5`, can generate new comparing conditions (`a<5 and b<5`) to have better filtering ability. [#73164](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73164) ([Shichao Jin](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Improve extraction of common expression in disjunctions. Allow simplifying the resulting filter expression even if there's no common subexpression for all the disjuncts.

[#73293](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73293) ([Xiaozhe Yu](https://github.com/wudidapaopao)).
* Introduce a setting `least_greatest_legacy_null_behavior` (default: `false`) which controls if functions `least` and `greatest` handle `NULL` arguments by unconditionally returning `NULL` (if `true`) or by ignoring them (if `false`). [#73344](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73344) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Use Keeper multi requests in cleanup thread ObjectStorageQueueMetadata. [#73357](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73357) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* A new MongoDB driver is now the default. Users who like to continue using the legacy driver can set server setting `use_legacy_mongodb_integration` to true. [#73359](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73359) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* When ClickHouse runs under cgroup, we will still collect system-wide asynchronous metrics related to system load, process scheduling, memory etc. They might provide useful signals when ClickHouse is the only process on the host with high resource consumption. [#73369](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73369) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* In storage S3Queue allow to transfer old ordered tables created before 24.6 to new structure with buckets. [#73467](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73467) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add `system.azure_queue` similar to existing `system.s3queue`. [#73477](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73477) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fixed a regression that using collation locales with modifiers throws an error. As an example, `SELECT arrayJoin(['kk 50', 'KK 01', ' KK 2', ' KK 3', 'kk 1', 'x9y99', 'x9y100']) item ORDER BY item ASC COLLATE 'tr-u-kn-true-ka-shifted` now works. [#73544](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73544) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Support type Nullable(JSON). [#73556](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73556) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Function `parseDateTime64` (and its variants) now produces correct results for input dates before 1970 / after 2106. Example: `SELECT parseDateTime64InJodaSyntax('2200-01-01 00:00:00.000', 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS')`. [#73594](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73594) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).

* Highlight trailing spaces in Pretty and Vertical formats in the terminal for better clarity. This is controlled with the `output_format_pretty_highlight_trailing_spaces` setting. Initial implementation by [Braden Burns](https://github.com/bradenburns) from [#72996](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72996). Closes [#71590](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71590). [#73847](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73847) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `clickhouse-client` and `clickhouse-local` will autodetect compression of stdin when it is redirected from a file. This closes [#70865](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70865). [#73848](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73848) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Cut too long column names in pretty formats by default.

This is the continuation of the work of [tanmaydatta](https://github.com/tanmaydatta) in [#66502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/66502). This closes [#65968](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65968). [#73851](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73851) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Make `Pretty` formats prettier: squash blocks if not much time passed since the output of the previous block. This is controlled by new settings `output_format_pretty_squash_consecutive_ms` (50 ms by default) and `output_format_pretty_squash_max_wait_ms` (1000 ms by default). Continuation of [#49537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49537). This closes [#49153](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49153).

* Fix type mapping for SQLite (integer types into `int64`, floating points into `float64`). [#73853](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73853) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Add a metric on the number of currently merging source parts. This closes [#70809](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70809). [#73868](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73868) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Highlight columns in the `Vertical` format if the output is to a terminal. This can be disabled with the `output_format_pretty_color` setting. [#73898](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73898) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Enhanced the MySQL compatibility to a level that now, `mysqlsh` (a rich MySQL CLI from Oracle) can connect to ClickHouse. This is needed to facilitate testing. [#73912](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73912) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* If the number of output records is larger than N = `output_format_pretty_max_rows`, instead of displaying only the first N rows, we will cut the output table in the middle, displaying N/2 first rows and N/2 last rows. Continuation of [#64200](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64200). This closes [#59502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59502). [#73929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73929) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The function `isIPv4String` returned true if the correct IPv4 address was followed by a zero byte, while it should return false in this case. Continuation of [#65387](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65387). [#73946](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73946) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Make the error code in the MySQL wire protocol compatible with MySQL. Continuation of [#56831](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/56831). Closes [#50957](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50957). [#73948](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73948) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add setting `validate_enum_literals_in_opearators` to validate enum literals in operators like `IN`, `NOT IN` against the enum type and throw an exception if the literal is not a valid enum value. [#73985](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73985) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* In Storage `S3(Azure)Queue` commit all files (in a single butch defined by commit settings) in a single keeper transaction. [#73991](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73991) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Disable header detection for executable UDFs and dictionaries (could lead to Function 'X': wrong result, expected Y row(s), actual Y-1). [#73992](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73992) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add the `distributed` option for `EXPLAIN PLAN.` Now, `EXPLAIN distributed=1 ... ` appends remote plan to `ReadFromParallelRemote*` steps. [#73994](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73994) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Use correct return type for not/xor with Dynamic arguments. [#74013](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74013) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow changing `add_implicit_sign_column_constraint_for_collapsing_engine` after table creation. [#74014](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74014) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Support subcolumns in materialized view select query. [#74030](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74030) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Pretty formats can render multi-line fields inside a table cell, which improves readability. This is enabled by default and can be controlled by the setting `output_format_pretty_multiline_fields`. Continuation of the work by [Volodyachan](https://github.com/Volodyachan) in [#64094](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64094). This closes [#56912](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/56912). [#74032](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74032) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support `predicate-push-down` optimization on the query plan level for the `MergingAggregated` step. It improves performance for some queries with the new analyzer. [#74073](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74073) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* There are now three simple ways to set a custom prompt in `clickhouse-client`: 1. via command-line parameter `--prompt`, 2. in the configuration file, via settings `<prompt>[...]</prompt>`, and 3. also in the configuration file, via per-connection settings `<connections_credentials><prompt>[...]</prompt></connection_credentials>`. [#74168](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74168) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Change prometheus remote write response success status from 200/OK to 204/NoContent. [#74170](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74170) ([Michael Dempsey](https://github.com/bluestealth)).
* Expose X-ClickHouse HTTP headers to JavaScript in the browser. It makes writing applications more convenient. [#74180](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74180) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `JSONEachRowWithProgress` format will include events with metadata, as well as totals and extremes. It also includes `rows_before_limit_at_least` and `rows_before_aggregation`. The format prints the exception properly if it arrives after partial results. The progress now includes elapsed nanoseconds. One final progress event is emitted at the end. The progress during query runtime will be printed no more frequently than the value of the `interactive_delay` setting. [#74181](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74181) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Hourglass will rotate smoothly in Play UI. [#74182](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74182) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Even if the HTTP response is compressed, send packets as soon as they arrive. This allows the browser to receive progress packets and compressed data. [#74201](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74201) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add ability to reload `max_remote_read_network_bandwidth_for_serve` and `max_remote_write_network_bandwidth_for_server` on fly without restart server. [#74206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74206) ([Kai Zhu](https://github.com/nauu)).
* Autodetect secure connection based on connecting to port 9440 in ClickHouse Client. [#74212](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74212) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Authenticate users with username only for http_handlers (previously it requires user to put the password as well). [#74221](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74221) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Support for the alternative query languages PRQL and KQL was marked experimental. To use them, specify settings `allow_experimental_prql_dialect = 1` and `allow_experimental_kusto_dialect = 1`. [#74224](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74224) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Support returning the default Enum type in more aggregate functions. [#74272](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74272) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* In `OPTIMIZE TABLE`, it is now possible to specify keyword `FORCE` as an alternative to existing keyword `FINAL`. [#74342](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74342) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Added a merge tree setting `materialize_skip_indexes_on_merge` which suppresses the creation of skip indexes during merge. This allows users to control explicitly (via `ALTER TABLE [..] MATERIALIZE INDEX [...]`) when skip indexes are created. This can be useful if skip indexes are expensive to build (e.g. vector similarity indexes). [#74401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74401) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Support subcolumns in default and materialized expressions. [#74403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74403) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Optimize keeper requests in Storage(S3/Azure)Queue. [#74410](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74410) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add the IsServerShuttingDown metric, which is needed to trigger an alert when the server shutdown takes too much time. [#74429](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74429) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Added iceberg tables names to EXPLAIN. [#74485](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74485) ([alekseev-maksim](https://github.com/alekseev-maksim)).
* Use up to `1000` parallel replicas by default. [#74504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74504) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Provide a better error message when using RECURSIVE CTE with the old analyzer. [#74523](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74523) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Optimize keeper requests in Storage(S3/Azure)Queue. [#74538](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74538) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Improve HTTP session reuse when reading from s3 disk ([#72401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72401)). [#74548](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74548) ([Julian Maicher](https://github.com/jmaicher)).
* Show extended error messages in `system.errors`. [#74574](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74574) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Enabled a backoff logic for all types of replicated tasks. It will provide the ability to reduce CPU usage, memory usage, and log file sizes. Added new settings `max_postpone_time_for_failed_replicated_fetches_ms`, `max_postpone_time_for_failed_replicated_merges_ms` and `max_postpone_time_for_failed_replicated_tasks_ms` which are similar to `max_postpone_time_for_failed_mutations_ms`. [#74576](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74576) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* More accurate accounting for `max_joined_block_size_rows` setting for `parallel_hash` JOIN algorithm. Helps to avoid increased memory consumption compared to `hash` algorithm. [#74630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74630) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Added `dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname` libhdfs3 config option support. [#74635](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74635) ([Mikhail Tiukavkin](https://github.com/freshertm)).
* Fixes Invalid: Codec 'snappy' doesn't support setting a compression level. [#74659](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74659) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Allow using password for client communication with clickhouse-keeper. This feature is not very useful if you specify proper SSL configuration for server and client, but still can be useful for some cases. Password cannot be longer than 16 characters. It's not connected with Keeper Auth model. [#74673](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74673) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Allow using blob paths to calculate checksums while making a backup. [#74729](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74729) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Use dynamic sharding for JOIN if the JOIN key is a prefix of PK for both parts. This optimization is enabled with `query_plan_join_shard_by_pk_ranges` setting (disabled by default). [#74733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74733) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Add error code for config reloader. [#74746](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74746) ([Garrett Thomas](https://github.com/garrettthomaskth)).
* Added support for IPv6 addresses in MySQL and PostgreSQL table functions and engines. [#74796](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74796) ([Mikhail Koviazin](https://github.com/mkmkme)).
* Parameters for the codec Gorilla will now always be saved in the table metadata in .sql file. This closes: [#70072](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70072). [#74814](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74814) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Implement short circuit optimization for `divideDecimal`. Fixes [#74280](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74280). [#74843](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74843) ([Kevin Mingtarja](https://github.com/kevinmingtarja)).
* Improve performance of larger multi requests in Keeper. [#74849](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74849) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Now users can be specified inside the startup scripts. [#74894](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74894) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Fetch parts in parallel in ALTER TABLE FETCH PARTITION (thread pool size is controlled with `max_fetch_partition_thread_pool_size`). [#74978](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74978) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added a query ID column to `system.query_cache` (issue [#68205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68205)). [#74982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74982) ([NamNguyenHoai](https://github.com/NamHoaiNguyen)).
* Enabled SSH protocol back. Fixed some critical vulnerabilities so that it is no longer possible to use custom pager or specify `server-logs-file`. Disabled the ability to pass client options through the environment variables by default (it is still possible via `ssh-server.enable_client_options_passing` in config.xml). Supported progress table, query cancellation, completion, profile events progress, stdin and `send_logs_level` option. This closes: [#74340](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74340). [#74989](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74989) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Fix formatting of exceptions using a custom format if they appear during query interpretation. In previous versions, exceptions were formatted using the default format rather than the format specified in the query. This closes [#55422](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/55422). [#74994](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74994) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Implemented parsing enhancements (Sequence ID parsing: Added functionality to parse sequence identifiers in manifest files AND Avro metadata parsing: Redesigned the Avro metadata parser to be easily extendable for future enhancements). [#75010](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75010) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* It is allowed to cancel `ALTER TABLE ... FREEZE ...` queries with `KILL QUERY` and timeout(`max_execution_time`). [#75016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75016) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* Add support for `groupUniqArrayArrayMap` as `SimpleAggregateFunction`. [#75034](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75034) ([Miel Donkers](https://github.com/mdonkers)).
* Support prepared statements in postgres wire protocol. [#75035](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75035) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Hide catalog credential settings in database engine `Iceberg`. Closes [#74559](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74559). [#75080](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75080) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Added a few missing features into BuzzHouse: `ILIKE` and `REGEXP` operators, `<=>` and `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`. [#75168](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75168) ([Pedro Ferreira](https://github.com/PedroTadim)).
* The setting `min_chunk_bytes_for_parallel_parsing` cannot be zero anymore. This fixes: [#71110](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71110). [#75239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75239) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* `intExp2` / `intExp10`: Define undefined behaviour: return 0 for too small argument, `18446744073709551615` for too big argument, throw exception if `nan`. [#75312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75312) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support `s3.endpoint` natively from catalog config in `DatabaseIceberg`. Closes [#74558](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74558). [#75375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75375) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Don't fail silently if user executing `SYSTEM DROP REPLICA` doesn't have enough permissions. [#75377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75377) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add a ProfileEvent about the number of times any of system logs has failed to flush. [#75466](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75466) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add check and logging for decrypting and decompressing. [#75471](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75471) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Added support for the micro sign (U+00B5) in the `parseTimeDelta` function. Now both the micro sign (U+00B5) and the Greek letter mu (U+03BC) are recognized as valid representations for microseconds, aligning ClickHouse's behavior with Go's implementation ([see time.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ad7b46ee4ac1cee5095d64b01e8cf7fcda8bee5e/src/time/time.go#L983C19-L983C20) and [time/format.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ad7b46ee4ac1cee5095d64b01e8cf7fcda8bee5e/src/time/format.go#L1608-L1609)). [#75472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75472) ([Vitaly Orlov](https://github.com/orloffv)).
* Replace server setting (`send_settings_to_client`) with client setting (`apply_settings_from_server`) that controls whether client-side code (e.g. parsing INSERT data and formatting query output) should use settings from server's `users.xml` and user profile. Otherwise only settings from client command line, session, and the query are used. Note that this only applies to native client (not e.g. HTTP), and doesn't apply to most of query processing (which happens on the server). [#75478](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75478) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Keeper improvement: disable digest calculation when committing to in-memory storage for better performance. It can be enabled with `keeper_server.digest_enabled_on_commit` config. Digest is still calculated when preprocessing requests. [#75490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75490) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Push down filter expression from JOIN ON when possible. [#75536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75536) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Better error messages at syntax errors. Previously, if the query was too large, and the token whose length exceeds the limit is a very large string literal, the message about the reason was lost in the middle of two examples of this very long token. Fix the issue when a query with UTF-8 was cut incorrectly in the error message. Fix excessive quoting of query fragments. This closes [#75473](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75473). [#75561](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75561) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add profile events in storage `S3(Azure)Queue`. [#75618](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75618) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Disable sending settings from server to client (`send_settings_to_client=false`) for compatibility (This feature will be re-implemented as client setting later for better usability). [#75648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75648) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Add a config `memory_worker_correct_memory_tracker` to enable correction of internal memory tracker with information from different source read in the background thread periodically. [#75714](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75714) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Use Analyzer in PrometheusRemoteReadProtocol. [#75729](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75729) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* We have support for gauge/counter metric types. However, they are insufficient for some metrics (e.g., the response times of requests to the keeper), so support for the histogram metric type is needed. The interface closely mirrors the Prometheus client, where you simply call `observe(value)` to increment the counter in the bucket corresponding to the value. The histogram metrics are exposed via system.histogram_metrics. [#75736](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75736) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Add column `normalized_query_hash` into `system.processes`. Note: while it can be easily calculated on the fly with the `normalizedQueryHash` function, this is needed to prepare for subsequent changes. [#75756](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75756) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Querying `system.tables` will not throw even if there is a `Merge` table created over a database that no longer exists. Remove the `getTotalRows` method from `Hive` tables, because we don't allow it to do complex work. [#75772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75772) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Web UI now has interactive database navigation. [#75777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75777) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow to combine read-only and read-write disks in storage policy (as multiple volumes, or multiple disks). This allows to read data from the entire volume, while inserts will prefer the writable disk (i.e. Copy-on-Write storage policy). [#75862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75862) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Remove trace_id from default ORDER BY for system.opentelemetry_span_log. [#75907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75907) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Encryption (XML attribute `encrypted_by`) can now be applied to any configuration file (config.xml, users.xml, nested configuration files). Previously, it worked only for the top-level config.xml file. [#75911](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75911) ([Mikhail Gorshkov](https://github.com/mgorshkov)).
* Store start_time/end_time for Backups with microseconds. [#75929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75929) ([Aleksandr Musorin](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).
* Add `MemoryTrackingUncorrected` metric showing value of internal global memory tracker which is not corrected by RSS. [#75935](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75935) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Calculate columns and indices sizes lazily in MergeTree. [#75938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75938) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Convert join to in subquery if output column is tied to the left table, need a uniqueness step at first, so disabled by default until the step is added later. [#75942](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75942) ([Shichao Jin](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Added a server setting `throw_on_unknown_workload` that allows to choose behavior on query with `workload` setting set to unknown value: either allow unlimited access (default) or throw a `RESOURCE_ACCESS_DENIED` error. It is useful to force all queries to use workload scheduling. [#75999](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75999) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Make the new, experimental Kafka table engine fully respect Keeper feature flags. [#76004](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76004) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Don't rewrite subcolumns to getSubcolumn in ARRAY JOIN if not necessary. [#76018](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76018) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Retry coordination errors when loading tables. [#76020](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76020) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Improve the `system.warnings` table and add some dynamic warning messages that can be added, updated or removed. [#76029](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76029) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Support flushing individual logs in SYSTEM FLUSH LOGS. [#76132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76132) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improved the `/binary` server's page. Using the Hilbert curve instead of the Morton curve. Display 512 MB worth of addresses in the square, which fills the square better (in previous versions, addresses fill only half of the square). Color addresses closer to the library name rather than the function name. Allow scrolling a bit more outside of the area. [#76192](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76192) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* This PR makes it impossible to run a query `ALTER USER user1 ADD PROFILES a, DROP ALL PROFILES` because all `DROP` operations should come first in the order. [#76242](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76242) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Various enhancements for SYNC REPLICA (better error messages, better tests, sanity checks). [#76307](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76307) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Retry ON CLUSTER queries in case of TOO_MANY_SIMULTANEOUS_QUERIES. [#76352](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76352) ([Patrick Galbraith](https://github.com/CaptTofu)).
* Changed the default value of `output_format_pretty_max_rows` from 10000 to 1000. I think it is better for usability. [#76407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76407) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Support for a refresh in readonly MergeTree tables. [#76467](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76467) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Use correct fallback when multipart copy to S3 fails during backup with Access Denied. Multi part copy can generate Access Denied error when backup is done between buckets that have different credentials. [#76515](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76515) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Faster ClickHouse Servers shutdown (get rid of 2.5sec delay). [#76550](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76550) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add query_id to system.errors. Related ticket [#75815](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75815). [#76581](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76581) ([Vladimir Baikov](https://github.com/bkvvldmr)).
* Upgraded librdkafka to version 2.8.0 and improved the shutdown sequence for Kafka tables, reducing delays during table drops and server restarts. The `engine=Kafka` no longer explicitly leaves the consumer group when a table is dropped. Instead, the consumer remains in the group until it is automatically removed after `session_timeout_ms` (default: 45 seconds) of inactivity. [#76621](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76621) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Fix validation of s3 request settings. [#76658](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76658) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Avoid excess allocation in readbufferfroms3 and other remote reading buffers, reduce their memory consumption in half. [#76692](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76692) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Support JSON type and subcolumns reading from View. [#76903](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76903) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Adding Support for Converting UInt128 to IPv6. This allows the `bitAnd` operation and arithmatics for IPv6 and conversion back to IPv6. Closes [#76752](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/76752). This allows the result from `bitAnd` operation on IPv6 to be converted back to IPv6, as well. See: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57707. [#76928](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76928) ([Muzammil Abdul Rehman](https://github.com/muzammilar)).
* System tables like `server_settings` or `settings` have a `default` value column which is convenient. only `merge_tree_settings` and `replicated_merge_tree_settings` do not have that column enabled. [#76942](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76942) ([Diego Nieto](https://github.com/lesandie)).
* Don't parse special Bool values in text formats inside Variant type by default. It can be enabled using setting `allow_special_bool_values_inside_variant`. [#76974](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76974) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support configurable per task waiting time of low priority query in session level and in server level. [#77013](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77013) ([VicoWu](https://github.com/VicoWu)).
* Added `ProfileEvents::QueryPreempted`, which has the same logic as `CurrentMetrics::QueryPreempted`. [#77015](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77015) ([VicoWu](https://github.com/VicoWu)).
* Previously database replicated might print credentials specified in a query to logs. This behaviour is fixed. This closes: [#77123](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/77123). [#77133](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77133) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Bump zstd from 1.5.5 to 1.5.7 which has pretty [good performance improvements](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases/tag/v1.5.7). [#77137](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77137) ([Pradeep Chhetri](https://github.com/chhetripradeep)).
* Allow ALTER TABLE DROP PARTITION for plain_rewritable disk. [#77138](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77138) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Add the ability to randomly sleep up to 500ms independent of part sizes before merges/mutations execution in case of zero-copy replication. [#77165](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77165) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Support atomic rename when `TRUNCATE` is used with `INTO OUTFILE`. Resolves [#70323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70323). [#77181](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77181) ([Onkar Deshpande](https://github.com/onkar)).
* Use FixedString for PostgreSQL's CHARACTER, CHAR and BPCHAR. [#77304](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77304) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
* Allow to explicitly specify metadata file to read for Iceberg with storage/table function setting `iceberg_metadata_file_path `. Fixes [#47412](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/47412). [#77318](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77318) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Support using a remote disk for databases to store metadata files. [#77365](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77365) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* Implement comparison for values of JSON data type. Now JSON objects can be compared similarly to Maps. [#77397](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77397) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Change reverted. [#77399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77399) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Backup/restore setting `allow_s3_native_copy` now supports value three possible values: - `False` - s3 native copy will not be used; - `True` (old default) - ClickHouse will try s3 native copy first, if it fails then fallback to the reading+writing approach; - `'auto'` (new default) - ClickHouse will compare the source and destination credentials first. If they are same, ClickHouse will try s3 native copy and then may fallback to the reading+writing approach. If they are different, ClickHouse will go directly to the reading+writing approach. [#77401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77401) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support ALTER TABLE ... ATTACH|DETACH|MOVE|REPLACE PARTITION for the plain_rewritable disk. [#77406](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77406) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Skipping index cache is reverted. [#77447](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77447) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Reduce memory usage during prefetches of JSON column in Wide parts. [#77640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77640) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support aws session token and environment credentials usage in delta kernel for DeltaLake table engine. [#77661](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77661) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Support query parameters inside `additional_table_filters` setting. After the change, the following query would succeed:. [#77680](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77680) ([wxybear](https://github.com/wxybear)).
* User-defined functions (UDFs) can now be marked as deterministic via a new tag in their XML definition. Also, the query cache now checks if UDFs called within a query are deterministic. If this is the case, it caches the query result. (Issue [#59988](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59988)). [#77769](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77769) ([Jimmy Aguilar Mena](https://github.com/Ergus)).
* Added Buffer table engine parameters validation. [#77840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77840) ([Pervakov Grigorii](https://github.com/GrigoryPervakov)).
* Add config `enable_hdfs_pread` to enable or disable hdfs pread. [#77885](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77885) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).

* Allow creating and inserting into temp table when disable_insertion_and_mutation is on. [#77901](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77901) ([Xu Jia](https://github.com/XuJia0210)).
* Decrease max_insert_delayed_streams_for_parallel_write (to 100). [#77919](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77919) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add ability to configure number of columns that merges can flush in parallel using `max_merge_delayed_streams_for_parallel_write` (this should reduce memory usage for vertical merges to S3 about 25x times). [#77922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77922) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix year parsing in joda syntax like 'yyy'. [#77973](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77973) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Attaching parts of MergeTree tables will be performed in their block order, which is important for special merging algorithms, such as ReplacingMergeTree. This closes [#71009](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71009). [#77976](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77976) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Query masking rules are now able to throw a LOGICAL_ERROR in case if the match happened. This will help to check if pre-defined password is leaking anywhere in logs. [#78094](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78094) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Added column `index_length_column` to `information_schema.tables` for better compatibility with MySQL. [#78119](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78119) ([Paweł Zakrzewski](https://github.com/KrzaQ)).
* Introduce two new metrics: `TotalMergeFailures` and `NonAbortedMergeFailures`. These metrics are needed to detect the cases where too many merges fail within a short period. [#78150](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78150) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Fix incorrect S3 uri parsing when key is not specified on path style. [#78185](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78185) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Fix incorrect values of `BlockActiveTime`, `BlockDiscardTime`, `BlockWriteTime`, `BlockQueueTime`, and `BlockReadTime` asynchronous metrics (before the change 1 second was incorrectly reported as 0.001). [#78211](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78211) ([filimonov](https://github.com/filimonov)).
* Respect `loading_retries` limit for errors during push to materialized view for StorageS3(Azure)Queue. Before that such errors were retried indefinitely. [#78313](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78313) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* In StorageDeltaLake with delta-kernel-rs implementation, fix performance and progress bar. [#78368](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78368) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Vector similarity index could over-allocate main memory by up to 2x. This fix reworks the memory allocation strategy, reducing the memory consumption and improving the effectiveness of the vector similarity index cache. (issue [#78056](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/78056)). [#78394](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78394) ([Shankar Iyer](https://github.com/shankar-iyer)).
* Introduce a setting `schema_type` for `system.metric_log` table with schema type. There are three allowed schemas: `wide` -- current schema, each metric/event in a separate column (most effective for reads of separate columns), `transposed` -- similar to `system.asynchronous_metric_log`, metrics/events are stored as rows, and the most interesting `transposed_with_wide_view` -- create underlying table with `transposed` schema, but also introduce a view with `wide` schema which translates queries to underlying table. In `transposed_with_wide_view` subsecond resolution for view is not supported, `event_time_microseconds` is just an alias for backward compatibility. [#78412](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78412) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Support `include`, `from_env`, `from_zk` for runtime disks. Closes [#78177](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/78177). [#78470](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78470) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add several convenient ways to resolve root metadata.json file in an iceberg table function and engine. Closes [#78455](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/78455). [#78475](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78475) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Support partition pruning in delta lake. [#78486](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78486) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Support password based auth in SSH protocol in ClickHouse. [#78586](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78586) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Add a dynamic warning to the `system.warnings` table for long running mutations. [#78658](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78658) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Drop connections if the CPU is massively overloaded. The decision is made based on the ratio of wait time (`OSCPUWaitMicroseconds`) to busy time (`OSCPUVirtualTimeMicroseconds`). The query is dropped with some probability, when this ratio is between `min_os_cpu_wait_time_ratio_to_drop_connection` and `max_os_cpu_wait_time_ratio_to_drop_connection`. [#78778](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78778) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Allow empty value on hive partitioning. [#78816](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78816) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Fix `IN` clause type coercion for `BFloat16` (i.e. `SELECT toBFloat16(1) IN [1, 2, 3];` now returns `1`). Closes [#78754](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/78754). [#78839](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78839) ([Raufs Dunamalijevs](https://github.com/rienath)).
* Do not check parts on other disks for MergeTree if disk= is set. [#78855](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78855) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Make data types in `used_data_type_families` in `system.query_log` canonical. [#78972](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78972) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

* Fix empty tuple handling in arrayIntersect. This fixes [#72578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72578). [#72581](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72581) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Fix handling of empty tuples in some input and output formats (e.g. Parquet, Arrow). [#72616](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72616) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Column-level GRANT SELECT/INSERT statements on wildcard databases/tables now throw an error. [#72646](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72646) ([Johann Gan](https://github.com/johanngan)).
* Fix the situation when a user can't run `REVOKE ALL ON *.*` because of implicit grants in the target access entity. [#72872](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72872) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Fix stuck while processing pending batch for async distributed INSERT (due to i.e. `No such file or directory`). [#72939](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72939) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add support for Azure SAS Tokens. [#72959](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72959) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fix positive timezone formatting of formatDateTime scalar function. [#73091](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73091) ([ollidraese](https://github.com/ollidraese)).
* Fix to correctly reflect source port when connection made through PROXYv1 and `auth_use_forwarded_address` is set - previously proxy port was incorrectly used. Add `currentQueryID()` function. [#73095](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73095) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).

* The `%f` placeholder of function `formatDateTime` now unconditionally generates six (sub-second) digits. This makes the behavior compatible with MySQL `DATE_FORMAT` function. The previous behavior can be restored using setting `formatdatetime_f_prints_scale_number_of_digits = 1`. [#73324](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73324) ([ollidraese](https://github.com/ollidraese)).
* Improved datetime conversion during index analysis by enforcing saturating behavior for implicit Date to DateTime conversions. This resolves potential index analysis inaccuracies caused by datetime range limitations. This fixes [#73307](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73307). It also fixes explicit `toDateTime` conversion when `date_time_overflow_behavior = 'ignore'` which is the default value. [#73326](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73326) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

* Fix preparing for squashin for Dynamic and JSON columns. Previously in some cases new types could be inserted into shared variant/shared data even when the limit on types/paths is not reached. [#73388](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73388) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Check for corrupted sizes during types binary decoding to avoid too big allocations. [#73390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73390) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fixed a logical error when reading from single-replica cluster with parallel replicas enabled. [#73403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73403) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).

* Fix `Block structure mismatch in QueryPipeline stream` error for some queries with `UNION ALL`. [#75715](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75715) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Rebuild projection on alter modify of its PK column. Previously it could lead to `CANNOT_READ_ALL_DATA` errors during selects after alter modify of the column used in projection PK. [#75720](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75720) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Fix uninitialized memory read in function `translate`. This closes [#75592](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75592). [#75794](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75794) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Propagate format settings to JSON as string formatting in Native format. [#75832](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75832) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Recorded the default enablement of parallel hash as join algorithm in v24.12 in the settings change history. This means that ClickHouse will continue to join using non-parallel hash if an older compatibility level than v24.12 is configured. [#75870](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75870) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Fixed a bug that tables with implicitly added min-max indices could not be copied into a new table (issue [#75677](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75677)). [#75877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75877) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* `clickhouse-library-bridge` allows opening arbitrary libraries from the filesystem, which makes it safe to run only inside an isolated environment. To prevent a vulnerability when it is run near the clickhouse-server, we will limit the paths of libraries to a location, provided in the configuration. This vulnerability was found with the [ClickHouse Bug Bounty Program](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38986) by **Arseniy Dugin**. [#75954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75954) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* We happened to use JSON serialization for some metadata, which was a mistake, because JSON does not support binary data inside string literals, including zero bytes. SQL queries can contain binary data and invalid UTF-8, so we have to support this in our metadata files as well. At the same time, ClickHouse's `JSONEachRow` and similar formats work around that by deviating from the JSON standard in favor of a perfect roundtrip for the binary data. See the motivation here: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73668#issuecomment-2560501790. The solution is to make `Poco::JSON` library consistent with the JSON format serialization in ClickHouse. This closes [#73668](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73668). [#75963](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75963) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fix posbile incorrect reference to unintialized key_index variable, which may lead to crash in debug builds (this uninitialized reference won't cause issues in release builds because subsequent code are likely to throw errors.) ### documentation entry for user-facing changes. [#77305](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77305) ([wxybear](https://github.com/wxybear)).

* Fix comparison between tuples with nullable elements inside and strings. As an example, before the change comparison between a Tuple `(1, null)` and a String `'(1,null)'` would result in an error. Another example would be a comparison between a Tuple `(1, a)`, where `a` is a Nullable column, and a String `'(1, 2)'`. This change addresses these issues. [#77323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77323) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).

* Fix checking if the table data path exists on the local disk. [#77608](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77608) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* The query cache now assumes that UDFs are non-deterministic. Accordingly, results of queries with UDFs are no longer cached. Previously, users were able to define non-deterministic UDFs whose result would erronously be cached (issue [#77553](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/77553)).

## Build/testing/packaging improvement {#build-testing-packaging-improvement}

* The internal dependency LLVM is bumped from 16 to 18. [#66053](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66053) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Restore deleted nats integration tests and fix errors. - fixed some race conditions in nats engine - fixed data loss when streaming data to nats in case of connection loss - fixed freeze of receiving the last chunk of data when streaming from nats ended - nats_max_reconnect is deprecated and has no effect, reconnect is performed permanently with nats_reconnect_wait timeout. [#69772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69772) ([Dmitry Novikov](https://github.com/dmitry-sles-novikov)).
* Fix the issue that asm files of contrib openssl cannot be generated. [#72622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72622) ([RinChanNOW](https://github.com/RinChanNOWWW)).
* Fix stability for test 03210_variant_with_aggregate_function_type. [#74012](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74012) ([Anton Ivashkin](https://github.com/ianton-ru)).
* Support build HDFS on both ARM and Intel Mac. [#74244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74244) ([Yan Xin](https://github.com/yxheartipp)).

* Fix build when kerberos is not enabled. [#74771](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74771) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Update to embedded LLVM 19. [#75148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75148) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* *Potentially breaking*: Improvement to set even more restrictive defaults. The current defaults are already secure. The user has to specify an option to publish ports explicitly. But when the `default` user doesn't have a password set by `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` and/or a username changed by `CLICKHOUSE_USER` environment variables, it should be available only from the local system as an additional level of protection. [#75259](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75259) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Integration tests have a 1-hour timeout for single batch of parallel tests running. When this timeout is reached `pytest` is killed without some logs. Internal pytest timeout is set to 55 minutes to print results from a session and not trigger external timeout signal. Closes [#75532](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75532). [#75533](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75533) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Make all clickhouse-server related actions a function, and execute them only when launching the default binary in `entrypoint.sh`. A long-postponed improvement was suggested in [#50724](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50724). Added switch `--users` to `clickhouse-extract-from-config` to get values from the `users.xml`. [#75643](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75643) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* For stress tests if server did not exit while we collected stacktraces via gdb additional wait time is added to make `Possible deadlock on shutdown (see gdb.log)` detection less noisy. It will only add delay for cases when test did not finish successfully. [#75668](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75668) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Restore deleted nats integration tests and fix errors. - fixed some race conditions in nats engine - fixed data loss when streaming data to nats in case of connection loss - fixed freeze of receiving the last chunk of data when streaming from nats ended - nats_max_reconnect is deprecated and has no effect, reconnect is performed permanently with nats_reconnect_wait timeout.

* Do not collect the `docker-compose` logs at the end of running since the script is often killed. Instead, collect them in the background. [#76140](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76140) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Split tests for kafka storage into a few files. Fixes [#69452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69452). [#76208](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76208) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* `clickhouse-odbc-bridge` and `clickhouse-library-bridge` are moved to a separate repository, https://github.com/ClickHouse/odbc-bridge/. [#76225](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76225) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Remove about 20MB of dead code from the binary. [#76226](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76226) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Raise minimum required CMake version to 3.25 due to `block()` introduction. [#76316](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76316) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).

* Bump `libcpuid` to `0.7.1`. [#76573](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76573) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Use a machine-readable format to parse pytest results. [#76910](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76910) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Fix rust cross-compilation and allow disabling Rust completely. [#76921](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76921) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Require clang 19 to build the project. [#76945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76945) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* The test is executed for 10+ seconds in the serial mode. It's too long for fast tests. [#76948](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76948) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Bump `sccache` to `0.10.0`. [#77580](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77580) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
