import ReplicationShardingTerminology from '@site/docs/_snippets/_replication-sharding-terminology.md';

The deployment examples in this section are based on the advice provided to ClickHouse users by
the ClickHouse Support and Services organization. These are working examples, and
we recommend that you try them and then adjust them to suit your needs. You may find
an example here that fits your requirements exactly.

We offer 'recipes' of a number of different topologies in the [example repo](https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/tree/main/docker-compose-recipes/recipes)
and recommend taking a look at them if the examples in this section do not fit your
needs exactly.
