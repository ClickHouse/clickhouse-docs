In order for replication to work, a ClickHouse keeper cluster needs to be set up and
configured. ClickHouse Keeper provides the coordination system for data replication,
acting as a stand in replacement for Zookeeper, which could also be used.
ClickHouse Keeper is, however, recommended, as it provides better guarantees and
reliability and uses fewer resources than ZooKeeper. For high availability and to
keep quorum, it is recommended to run at least three ClickHouse Keeper nodes.

:::note
ClickHouse Keeper can run on any node of the cluster alongside ClickHouse, although
it is recommended to have it run on a dedicated node which allows scaling and
managing the ClickHouse Keeper cluster independently of the database cluster.
:::

Create the `keeper_config.xml` files for each ClickHouse Keeper node
using the following command from the root of the example folder:

```bash
for i in {01..03}; do
  touch fs/volumes/clickhouse-keeper-${i}/etc/clickhouse-keeper/keeper_config.xml
done
```

Modify the empty configuration files which were created in each
node directory `fs/volumes/clickhouse-keeper-{}/etc/clickhouse-keeper`. The
highlighted lines below need to be changed to be specific to each node:

```xml title="/clickhouse-keeper/keeper_config.xml"
