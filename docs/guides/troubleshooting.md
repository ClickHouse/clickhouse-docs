## Installation {#installation}

### Cannot import GPG keys from keyserver.ubuntu.com with apt-key {#cannot-import-gpg-keys-from-keyserverubuntucom-with-apt-key}

The `apt-key` feature with the [Advanced package tool (APT) has been deprecated](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/apt/apt-key.8.en.html). Users should use the `gpg` command instead. Please refer the [install guide](../getting-started/install/install.mdx) article.

### Cannot import GPG keys from keyserver.ubuntu.com with gpg {#cannot-import-gpg-keys-from-keyserverubuntucom-with-gpg}

1. See if your `gpg` is installed:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install gnupg
    ```

### Cannot get deb packages from ClickHouse repository with apt-get {#cannot-get-deb-packages-from-clickhouse-repository-with-apt-get}

1. Check firewall settings.
1. If you cannot access the repository for any reason, download packages as described in the [install guide](../getting-started/install/install.mdx) article and install them manually using the `sudo dpkg -i <packages>` command. You will also need the `tzdata` package.

### Cannot update deb packages from ClickHouse repository with apt-get {#cannot-update-deb-packages-from-clickhouse-repository-with-apt-get}

The issue may be happened when the GPG key is changed.

Please use the manual from the [setup](/install/debian_ubuntu) page to update the repository configuration.

### You get different warnings with `apt-get update` {#you-get-different-warnings-with-apt-get-update}

The completed warning messages are as one of following:

```shell
N: Skipping acquire of configured file 'main/binary-i386/Packages' as repository 'https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb stable InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'
```

```shell
E: Failed to fetch https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb/dists/stable/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz  File has unexpected size (30451 != 28154). Mirror sync in progress?
```

```shell
E: Repository 'https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb stable InRelease' changed its 'Origin' value from 'Artifactory' to 'ClickHouse'
E: Repository 'https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb stable InRelease' changed its 'Label' value from 'Artifactory' to 'ClickHouse'
N: Repository 'https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb stable InRelease' changed its 'Suite' value from 'stable' to ''
N: This must be accepted explicitly before updates for this repository can be applied. See apt-secure(8) manpage for details.
```

```shell
Err:11 https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb stable InRelease
400  Bad Request [IP: 172.66.40.249 443]
```

To resolve the above issue, please use the following script:

```shell
sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/packages.clickhouse.com_* /var/lib/dpkg/arch /var/lib/apt/lists/partial/packages.clickhouse.com_*
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get autoclean
```

### Can't get packages with Yum because of wrong signature {#cant-get-packages-with-yum-because-of-wrong-signature}

Possible issue: the cache is wrong, maybe it's broken after updated GPG key in 2022-09.

The solution is to clean out the cache and lib directory for Yum:

```shell
sudo find /var/lib/yum/repos/ /var/cache/yum/ -name 'clickhouse-*' -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
sudo rm -f /etc/yum.repos.d/clickhouse.repo
```

After that follow the [install guide](/install/redhat)

## Connecting to the server {#connecting-to-the-server}

Possible issues:

- The server is not running.
- Unexpected or wrong configuration parameters.

### Server is not running {#server-is-not-running}

#### Check if server is running {#check-if-server-is-running}

```shell
sudo service clickhouse-server status
```

If the server is not running, start it with the command:

```shell
sudo service clickhouse-server start
```

#### Check the logs {#check-the-logs}

The main log of `clickhouse-server` is in `/var/log/clickhouse-server/clickhouse-server.log` by default.

If the server started successfully, you should see the strings:

- `<Information> Application: starting up.` — Server started.
- `<Information> Application: Ready for connections.` — Server is running and ready for connections.

    If `clickhouse-server` start failed with a configuration error, you should see the `<Error>` string with an error description. For example:

    ```plaintext
    2019.01.11 15:23:25.549505 [ 45 ] {} <Error> ExternalDictionaries: Failed reloading 'event2id' external dictionary: Poco::Exception. Code: 1000, e.code() = 111, e.displayText() = Connection refused, e.what() = Connection refused
    ```

    If you do not see an error at the end of the file, look through the entire file starting from the string:

    ```plaintext
    <Information> Application: starting up.
    ```

    If you try to start a second instance of `clickhouse-server` on the server, you see the following log:

    ```plaintext
    2019.01.11 15:25:11.151730 [ 1 ] {} <Information> : Starting ClickHouse 19.1.0 with revision 54413
    2019.01.11 15:25:11.154578 [ 1 ] {} <Information> Application: starting up
    2019.01.11 15:25:11.156361 [ 1 ] {} <Information> StatusFile: Status file ./status already exists - unclean restart. Contents:

    Revision: 54413

    2019.01.11 15:25:11.156673 [ 1 ] {} <Error> Application: DB::Exception: Cannot lock file ./status. Another server instance in same directory is already running.
    2019.01.11 15:25:11.156682 [ 1 ] {} <Information> Application: shutting down
    2019.01.11 15:25:11.156686 [ 1 ] {} <Debug> Application: Uninitializing subsystem: Logging Subsystem
    2019.01.11 15:25:11.156716 [ 2 ] {} <Information> BaseDaemon: Stop SignalListener thread
    ```

#### See system.d logs {#see-systemd-logs}

If you do not find any useful information in `clickhouse-server` logs or there aren't any logs, you can view `system.d` logs using the command:

```shell
sudo journalctl -u clickhouse-server
```

#### Start clickhouse-server in interactive mode {#start-clickhouse-server-in-interactive-mode}

```shell
sudo -u clickhouse /usr/bin/clickhouse-server --config-file /etc/clickhouse-server/config.xml
```

This command starts the server as an interactive app with standard parameters of the autostart script. In this mode `clickhouse-server` prints all the event messages in the console.

### Configuration parameters {#configuration-parameters}

Check:

1. Docker settings:

    - If you run ClickHouse in Docker in an IPv6 network, make sure that `network=host` is set.

1. Endpoint settings.
    - Check [listen_host](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#listen_host) and [tcp_port](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#tcp_port) settings.
    - ClickHouse server accepts localhost connections only by default.

1. HTTP protocol settings:

    - Check protocol settings for the HTTP API.

1. Secure connection settings.

    - Check:
        - The [tcp_port_secure](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#tcp_port_secure) setting.
        - Settings for [SSL certificates](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#openssl).
    - Use proper parameters while connecting. For example, use the `port_secure` parameter with `clickhouse_client`.

1. User settings:

    - You might be using the wrong user name or password.

## Query processing {#query-processing}

If ClickHouse is not able to process the query, it sends an error description to the client. In the `clickhouse-client` you get a description of the error in the console. If you are using the HTTP interface, ClickHouse sends the error description in the response body. For example:

```shell
$ curl 'http://localhost:8123/' --data-binary "SELECT a"
Code: 47, e.displayText() = DB::Exception: Unknown identifier: a. Note that there are no tables (FROM clause) in your query, context: required_names: 'a' source_tables: table_aliases: private_aliases: column_aliases: public_columns: 'a' masked_columns: array_join_columns: source_columns: , e.what() = DB::Exception
```

If you start `clickhouse-client` with the `stack-trace` parameter, ClickHouse returns the server stack trace with the description of an error.

You might see a message about a broken connection. In this case, you can repeat the query. If the connection breaks every time you perform the query, check the server logs for errors.

## Efficiency of query processing {#efficiency-of-query-processing}

If you see that ClickHouse is working too slowly, you need to profile the load on the server resources and network for your queries.

You can use the clickhouse-benchmark utility to profile queries. It shows the number of queries processed per second, the number of rows processed per second, and percentiles of query processing times.
