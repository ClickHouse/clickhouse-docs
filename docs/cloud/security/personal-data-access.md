## Intro {#intro}

As a registered user, ClickHouse allows you to view and manage your personal account data, including contact information. Depending on your role, this may also include access to the contact information of other users in your organization, API key details, and other relevant information. You can manage these details directly through the ClickHouse console on a self-serve basis.

**What is a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR)**

Depending on where you are located, applicable law may also provide you additional rights as to personal data that ClickHouse holds about you (Data Subject Rights), as described in the ClickHouse Privacy Policy.  The process for exercising Data Subject Rights is known as a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR).

**Scope of Personal Data**

Please review ClickHouse's Privacy Policy for details on personal data that ClickHouse collects and how it may be used.

## Self service {#self-service}

By default, ClickHouse empowers users to view their personal data directly from the ClickHouse console.

Below is a summary of the data ClickHouse collects during account setup and service usage, along with information on where specific personal data can be viewed within the ClickHouse console.
