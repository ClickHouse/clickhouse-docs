## Upload a file {#upload-file}

From the Cloud homepage, select your service as shown below:

<Image img={csv_01} alt="upload_file_02" />

If your service is idle you will need to wake it.

Select `Data sources` in the left hand tab as shown below:

<Image img={csv_02} alt="upload_file_03" />

Next select `Upload a file` on the right side of the data sources page:

A file dialogue will pop up allowing you to select the file that you wish to 
use to insert data into a table on your Cloud service.

## Configure table {#configure-table}

Once the file has uploaded you will be able to configure the table where you want 
to insert the data to. A preview of the table with the first three rows is shown.

You can now select a destination table. The options are:

- a new table
- an existing table

<br/>
You can specify which database you want to upload the data to, and in the case of 
a new table, the name of the table that will be created. You will also be able to select the sorting key:

Columns read from the file are shown as `Source field`s and for each field, you
can change:
- the inferred type
- the default value
- whether to make the column [Nullable](/sql-reference/data-types/nullable) or not

:::note Excluding fields
You can also remove a field if you don't want to include it in the import
:::

You can specify the type of table engine that you want to use:

- `MergeTree`
- `ReplacingMergeTree`
- `SummingMergeTree`
- `Null`
<br/>
You can specify a partitioning key expression and primary
key expression.

Click `Import to ClickHouse` (shown above) to import the data. The data import will be queued as
indicated by the `queued` status badge in the `Status` column as shown below. You can also click
`Open as query` (shown above) to open the insert query in the SQL console. The query will insert
the file which was uploaded to an S3 bucket using the `URL` table function.

<Image img={csv_09} alt="upload_file_09" />

If the job fails you will see a `failed` status badge under the `Status` column of 
the `Data upload history` tab. You can click `View Details` for more information 
on why the upload failed. You may need to modify the table configuration or clean
the data based on the error message for the failed insert.
