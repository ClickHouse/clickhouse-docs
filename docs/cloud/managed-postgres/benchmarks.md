## TL;DR {#tldr}

We benchmarked Postgres managed by ClickHouse against AWS RDS (with 16k provisioned IOPS) and Aurora IO Optimized using standard [`pgbench`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbench.html) tests. **Results show that ClickHouse's NVMe-backed Postgres delivers 4.3-9x faster performance for IO-intensive workloads and 12% faster for CPU-bound scenarios.** This exceptional throughput and scalability makes it ideal for fast-growing AI-driven workloads that demand high transaction rates, low-latency data access, and predictable performance without IO bottlenecks.

## Benchmark overview {#overview}

We conducted comprehensive performance testing using `pgbench`, the standard PostgreSQL benchmarking tool, to evaluate workload performance under both moderate and high-concurrency scenarios.

## Benchmarks {#benchmarks}

All performance tests were conducted using a client VM with the same compute capacity, collocated in the same region and availability zone as the PostgreSQL database to ensure fair comparison.

### Test 1: IO Intensive - Read+Write (500 GB dataset) {#test1}

<Image img={ioReadWrite} alt="IO Intensive Read+Write benchmark results" size="md" border/>

**Performance improvement over RDS (16k IOPS):**
- **326% higher TPS** (4.3x faster)

**Performance improvement over Aurora IO Optimized:**
- **345% higher TPS** (4.5x faster)

**Analysis**: Mixed read/write workloads showcase the most dramatic performance advantages of NVMe storage and represent the **most realistic scenario for fast-growing AI-driven workloads** that require both high-throughput data ingestion and low-latency reads. **Postgres managed by ClickHouse achieved 19.8K TPS with higher concurrency**, demonstrating how NVMe storage scales effectively under load. This is **4.3-4.5x faster than RDS and Aurora**. Network-attached storage solutions struggled with write-heavy operations, with RDS and Aurora maxing out at 4.4K-4.6K TPS despite provisioned capacity and even with Aurora's IO Optimized configuration.

#### Setup {#test1-setup}

This test evaluates mixed read/write performance with a large 500 GB dataset, stressing both read and write paths of the storage subsystem.

**Instance configuration:**

| Configuration  | Postgres managed by ClickHouse | RDS with 16k IOPS              | Aurora IO Optimized             |
|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **PG Version** | 17                             | 17                             | 17                              |
| **vCPUs**      | 16                             | 16                             | 16                              |
| **RAM**        | 64 GB                          | 64 GB                          | 128 GB                          |
| **Disk Size**  | 1 TB                           | 1 TB                           | 1 TB                            |
| **Disk Type**  | NVMe (unlimited IOPS)          | Network-attached (16,000 IOPS) | Network-attached (IO Optimized) |

**Test configuration:**

```bash
# Initialize database (500 GB dataset)
pgbench -i -s 34247

# Read+Write benchmark
pgbench -c 256 -j 16 -T 600 -M prepared -P 30
```

### Test 2: IO Intensive - Read-Only (500 GB dataset) {#test2}

<Image img={ioReadOnly} alt="IO Intensive Read-Only benchmark results" size="md" border/>

**Performance improvement over RDS (16k IOPS):**
- **802% higher TPS** (9.0x faster)

**Analysis**: The performance gap widens dramatically for read-intensive workloads that are IO Bound. **Postgres managed by ClickHouse delivered 84.8K TPS**, while RDS with 16,000 provisioned IOPS achieved only 9.4K TPS despite having equivalent compute resources. The key difference: ClickHouse's NVMe storage scales with higher concurrency, while network-attached storage remains constrained by provisioned IOPS limits. Even with provisioned IOPS, RDS was still 9x slower than ClickHouse, demonstrating the critical importance of storage architecture for IO-intensive workloads.

#### Setup {#test2-setup}

This test evaluates read performance with a large 500 GB dataset that doesn't fit in memory, stressing disk I/O capabilities.

**Instance configuration:**

| Configuration  | Postgres managed by ClickHouse | RDS with 16k IOPS              |
|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **PG Version** | 17                             | 17                             |
| **vCPUs**      | 16                             | 16                             |
| **RAM**        | 64 GB                          | 64 GB                          |
| **Disk Size**  | 1 TB                           | 1 TB                           |
| **Disk Type**  | NVMe (unlimited IOPS)          | Network-attached (16,000 IOPS) |

**Test configuration:**

```bash
# Initialize database (500 GB dataset)
pgbench -i -s 34247

# Read-only benchmark
pgbench -c 256 -j 16 -T 600 -M prepared -P 30 -S
```

### Test 3: CPU Intensive (data fits in memory) {#test3}

<Image img={computeIntensive} alt="CPU Intensive benchmark results" size="md" border/>

**Performance improvement:**
- **12.3% higher TPS** than RDS PostgreSQL

**Analysis**: Even in CPU-bound scenarios where disk I/O is minimal, **Postgres managed by ClickHouse led the pack with 36.5K TPS**. Despite both services hitting 100% CPU utilization, ClickHouse's NVMe storage delivered superior performance with better cache hit rates. The 12% advantage over RDS demonstrates the efficiency of the underlying infrastructure even when workloads are primarily CPU-bound.

#### Setup {#test3-setup}

This test evaluates CPU performance when the working set fits entirely in memory, minimizing disk I/O impact.

**Instance configuration:**

| Configuration  | Postgres managed by ClickHouse | RDS PostgreSQL         |
|----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|
| **PG Version** | 17                             | 17                     |
| **vCPUs**      | 2                              | 2                      |
| **RAM**        | 8 GB                           | 8 GB                   |
| **Disk Type**  | NVMe                           | Network-attached (gp3) |

**Test configuration:**

```bash
# Initialize database (2 GB dataset)
pgbench -i -s 136

# Warm-up run to load dataset into memory
pgbench -c 1 -T 60 -S -M prepared

# Run benchmark (read-only, prepared statements)
pgbench -c 32 -j 16 -T 300 -S -M prepared -P 30
```

## Performance summary {#summary}

### Key findings {#key-findings}

Across all three benchmark scenarios, Postgres managed by ClickHouse consistently delivered superior performance:

1. **IO-intensive read+write workloads**: 4.3-4.5x higher TPS compared to RDS (16k IOPS) and Aurora IO Optimized
2. **IO-intensive read workloads**: 9x higher TPS compared to RDS with 16k IOPS
3. **CPU-bound workloads**: 12% higher TPS than RDS

### When Postgres by ClickHouse excels {#when-it-excels}

Postgres by ClickHouse is ideal for applications that:
- **Power fast-growing AI-driven workloads** requiring high-throughput data ingestion with frequent upserts, real-time feature updates, and analytics out of the box through seamless integration with ClickHouse for OLAP workloads
- Perform frequent writes, updates, or mixed read/write operations
- Need predictable, high-performance storage
- Are currently constrained by IOPS limits on traditional managed Postgres services

**If you expect analytics later** and anticipate deeper ClickHouse integration—common in modern AI workloads where transactional data feeds real-time dashboards, feature stores, and ML pipelines—**Postgres by ClickHouse should be your default go-to choice**. The native integration eliminates complex ETL pipelines and enables seamless data flow between your operational database and analytical queries.

### NVMe architecture advantage {#nvme-advantage}

The performance advantage comes from the fundamental architectural difference:

| Aspect                  | NVMe Storage (Managed Postgres)     | Network-Attached Storage (Provisioned IOPS)        |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **IOPS**                | 100k to virtually unlimited         | 16,000 provisioned                                 |
| **Network hops**        | Zero (local device)                 | Every disk operation requires network round trip   |
| **Performance scaling** | Scales linearly with concurrency    | Limited by provisioned IOPS                        |

For more details on the performance benefits of NVMe storage, see [NVMe-powered performance](/cloud/managed-postgres/overview#nvme-performance).

## Cost-effectiveness {#cost-effectiveness}

Beyond raw performance, Postgres managed by ClickHouse offers superior price-performance:

- **Higher throughput per dollar**: Achieve 4-9x more TPS compared to RDS with 16k provisioned IOPS and Aurora IO Optimized
- **Predictable costs**: No need to provision additional IOPS capacity—unlimited local IOPS included
- **Lower compute requirements**: Achieve target performance with smaller instance sizes due to efficient I/O
- **Reduced need for read replicas**: Higher single-instance throughput reduces need for horizontal scaling

For workloads currently constrained by IOPS limits, switching to Managed Postgres can eliminate the need for expensive provisioned IOPS or IO-optimized configurations while delivering significantly better performance.
