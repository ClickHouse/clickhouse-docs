## pg_clickhouse extension {#pg-clickhouse}

The `pg_clickhouse` extension is pre-installed on every Managed Postgres instance. It allows you to query ClickHouse databases directly from PostgreSQL, enabling a unified query layer for both transactions and analytics.

See the [pg_clickhouse documentation](/integrations/pg_clickhouse) for setup instructions and usage details.
