# Quickstart for Managed Postgres
:::tip Now available
Managed Postgres is now available in ClickHouse Cloud in Private Preview! Get started in minutes by clicking [here](https://clickhouse.com/cloud/postgres).
:::

ClickHouse Managed Postgres is enterprise-grade Postgres backed by NVMe storage, delivering up to 10x faster performance for disk-bound workloads compared to network-attached storage like EBS. This quickstart is divided into two parts:

- **Part 1:** Get started with NVMe Postgres and experience its performance
- **Part 2:** Unlock real-time analytics by integrating with ClickHouse

Managed Postgres is currently available on AWS in several regions and is free during private preview.

**In this quickstart, you will:**
- Create a Managed Postgres instance with NVMe-powered performance
- Load 1 million sample events and see NVMe speed in action
- Run queries and experience low-latency performance
- Replicate data to ClickHouse for real-time analytics
- Query ClickHouse directly from Postgres using `pg_clickhouse`

## Part 1: Get Started with NVMe Postgres {#part-1}

### Create a database {#create-postgres-database}

To create a new Managed Postgres service, click on the **New service** button in the service list of the Cloud Console. You should then be able to select Postgres as the database type.

<Image img={createPg} alt="Create a managed Postgres service" size="md" border/>

Enter a name for your database instance and click on **Create service**. You will be taken to the overview page.

<Image img={pgOverview} alt="Managed Postgres overview" size="md" border/>

Your Managed Postgres instance will be provisioned and ready for use in 3-5 minutes.

### Connect to your database {#connect}

In the sidebar on the left, you will see a [**Connect** button](/cloud/managed-postgres/connection). Click on it to view your connection details and connection strings in multiple formats.

<Image img={connectModal} alt="Managed Postgres connect modal" size="md" border/>

Copy the `psql` connection string and connect to your database. You can also use any Postgres-compatible client such as DBeaver, or any application library.

### Experience NVMe performance {#nvme-performance}

Let's see NVMe-powered performance in action. First, enable timing in psql to measure query execution:

```sql
\timing
```

Create two sample tables for events and users:

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
   event_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   event_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
   event_type VARCHAR(100),
   event_timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   event_data JSONB,
   user_id INT,
   user_ip INET,
   is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
   created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
   updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE users (
   user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(100),
   country VARCHAR(50),
   platform VARCHAR(50)
);
```

Now, insert 1 million events and watch the NVMe speed:

```sql
INSERT INTO events (event_name, event_type, event_timestamp, event_data, user_id, user_ip)
SELECT
   'Event ' || gs::text AS event_name,
   CASE
       WHEN random() < 0.5 THEN 'click'
       WHEN random() < 0.75 THEN 'view'
       WHEN random() < 0.9 THEN 'purchase'
       WHEN random() < 0.98 THEN 'signup'
       ELSE 'logout'
   END AS event_type,
   NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day' * (gs % 365) AS event_timestamp,
   jsonb_build_object('key', 'value' || gs::text, 'additional_info', 'info_' || (gs % 100)::text) AS event_data,
   GREATEST(1, LEAST(1000, FLOOR(POWER(random(), 2) * 1000) + 1)) AS user_id,
   ('192.168.1.' || ((gs % 254) + 1))::inet AS user_ip
FROM
   generate_series(1, 1000000) gs;
```

```text
INSERT 0 1000000
Time: 3596.542 ms (00:03.597)
```

:::tip NVMe Performance
1 million rows with JSONB data inserted in under 4 seconds. On traditional cloud databases using network-attached storage like EBS, this same operation typically takes 2-3x longer due to network round-trip latency and IOPS throttling. NVMe storage eliminates these bottlenecks by keeping storage physically attached to the compute.

Performance varies based on instance size, current load, and data characteristics.
:::

Insert 1,000 users:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, country, platform)
SELECT
    first_names[first_idx] || ' ' || last_names[last_idx] AS name,
    CASE
        WHEN random() < 0.25 THEN 'India'
        WHEN random() < 0.5 THEN 'USA'
        WHEN random() < 0.7 THEN 'Germany'
        WHEN random() < 0.85 THEN 'China'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS country,
    CASE
        WHEN random() < 0.2 THEN 'iOS'
        WHEN random() < 0.4 THEN 'Android'
        WHEN random() < 0.6 THEN 'Web'
        WHEN random() < 0.75 THEN 'Windows'
        WHEN random() < 0.9 THEN 'MacOS'
        ELSE 'Linux'
    END AS platform
FROM
    generate_series(1, 1000) AS seq
    CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
        SELECT
            array['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Diana', 'Eve', 'Frank', 'Grace', 'Hank', 'Ivy', 'Jack', 'Liam', 'Olivia', 'Noah', 'Emma', 'Sophia', 'Benjamin', 'Isabella', 'Lucas', 'Mia', 'Amelia', 'Aarav', 'Riya', 'Arjun', 'Ananya', 'Wei', 'Li', 'Huan', 'Mei', 'Hans', 'Klaus', 'Greta', 'Sofia'] AS first_names,
            array['Smith', 'Johnson', 'Williams', 'Brown', 'Jones', 'Garcia', 'Miller', 'Davis', 'Martinez', 'Taylor', 'Anderson', 'Thomas', 'Jackson', 'White', 'Harris', 'Martin', 'Thompson', 'Moore', 'Lee', 'Perez', 'Sharma', 'Patel', 'Gupta', 'Reddy', 'Zhang', 'Wang', 'Chen', 'Liu', 'Schmidt', 'Müller', 'Weber', 'Fischer'] AS last_names,
            1 + (seq % 32) AS first_idx,
            1 + ((seq / 32)::int % 32) AS last_idx
    ) AS names;
```

### Run queries on your data {#run-queries}

Now let's run some queries to see how fast Postgres responds with NVMe storage.

**Aggregate 1 million events by type:**

```sql
SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM events 
GROUP BY event_type 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

```text
 event_type | count  
------------+--------
 click      | 499523
 view       | 375644
 purchase   | 112473
 signup     |  12117
 logout     |    243
(5 rows)

Time: 114.883 ms
```

**Query with JSONB filtering and date range:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM events 
WHERE event_timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND event_data->>'additional_info' LIKE 'info_5%';
```

```text
 count 
-------
  9042
(1 row)

Time: 109.294 ms
```

**Join events with users:**

```sql
SELECT u.country, COUNT(*) as events, AVG(LENGTH(e.event_data::text))::int as avg_json_size
FROM events e
JOIN users u ON e.user_id = u.user_id
GROUP BY u.country
ORDER BY events DESC;
```

```text
 country | events | avg_json_size 
---------+--------+---------------
 USA     | 383748 |            52
 India   | 255990 |            52
 Germany | 223781 |            52
 China   | 127754 |            52
 Other   |   8727 |            52
(5 rows)

Time: 224.670 ms
```

:::note Your Postgres is ready
At this point, you have a fully functional, high-performance Postgres database ready for your transactional workloads.

Continue to Part 2 to see how native ClickHouse integration can supercharge your analytics.
:::

## Part 2: Add Real-Time Analytics with ClickHouse {#part-2}

While Postgres excels at transactional workloads (OLTP), ClickHouse is purpose-built for analytical queries (OLAP) on large datasets. By integrating the two, you get the best of both worlds:

- **Postgres** for your application's transactional data (inserts, updates, point lookups)
- **ClickHouse** for sub-second analytics on billions of rows

This section shows you how to replicate your Postgres data to ClickHouse and query it seamlessly.

### Setup ClickHouse integration {#setup-integrate-clickhouse}
Now that we have tables and data in Postgres, let's replicate the tables to ClickHouse for analytics. We start by clicking on **ClickHouse integration** in the sidebar. Then you can click on **Replicate data in ClickHouse**.
<Image img={integrationLanding} alt="Managed Postgres integration empty" size="md" border/>
In the form that follows, you can enter a name for your integration and select an existing ClickHouse instance to replicate to. If you don't have a ClickHouse instance yet, you can create one directly from this form.
:::info Important
Make sure the ClickHouse service you select is Running before proceeding.
:::
<Image img={postgresAnalyticsForm} alt="Managed Postgres integration form" size="md" border/>

Click on **Next**, to be taken to the table picker. Here all you need to do is:
- Select a ClickHouse database to replicate to.
- Expand the **public** schema and select the users and events table we created earlier.
- Click on **Replicate data to ClickHouse**.

<Image img={tablePicker} alt="Managed Postgres table picker" size="md" border/>

The replication process will start, and you will be taken to the integration overview page. Being the first integration, it can take 2-3 minutes to setup the initial infrastructure. In the meantime let's check out the new **pg_clickhouse** extension.

### Query ClickHouse from Postgres {#pg-clickhouse-extension}

The `pg_clickhouse` extension lets you query ClickHouse data directly from Postgres using standard SQL. This means your application can use Postgres as a unified query layer for both transactional and analytical data. See the [full documentation](/integrations/pg_clickhouse) for details.

Enable the extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_clickhouse;
```

Then, create a foreign server connection to ClickHouse. Use the `http` driver with port `8443` for secure connections:

```sql
CREATE SERVER ch FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER clickhouse_fdw
       OPTIONS(driver 'http', host '<clickhouse_cloud_host>', dbname '<database_name>', port '8443');
```

Replace `<clickhouse_cloud_host>` with your ClickHouse hostname and `<database_name>` with the database you selected during replication setup. You can find the hostname in your ClickHouse service by clicking **Connect** in the sidebar.

<Image img={getClickHouseHost} alt="Get ClickHouse host" size="md" border/>

Now, we map the Postgres user to the ClickHouse service's credentials:
```sql
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR CURRENT_USER SERVER ch 
OPTIONS (user 'default', password '<clickhouse_password>');
```
Now import the ClickHouse tables into a Postgres schema:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA organization;
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA "<database_name>" FROM SERVER ch INTO organization;
```

Replace `<database_name>` with the same database name you used when creating the server.

You can now see all the ClickHouse tables in your Postgres client:

```sql
\det+ organization.*
```

### See your analytics in action {#analytics-after-integration}

Let's check back on the integration page. You should see that the initial replication is complete. Click on the integration name to view details.

<Image img={analyticsList} alt="Managed Postgres analytics list" size="md" border/>

Click on the service name to open the ClickHouse console and see your replicated tables.

<Image img={replicatedTables} alt="Managed Postgres replicated tables in ClickHouse" size="md" border/>

### Compare Postgres vs ClickHouse performance {#performance-comparison}

Now let's run some analytical queries and compare performance between Postgres and ClickHouse. Note that replicated tables use the naming convention `public_<table_name>`.

**Query 1: Top users by activity**

This query finds the most active users with multiple aggregations:

```sql
-- Via ClickHouse
SELECT 
    user_id,
    COUNT(*) as total_events,
    COUNT(DISTINCT event_type) as unique_event_types,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as purchases,
    MIN(event_timestamp) as first_event,
    MAX(event_timestamp) as last_event
FROM organization.public_events
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY total_events DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```text
 user_id | total_events | unique_event_types | purchases |        first_event         |         last_event         
---------+--------------+--------------------+-----------+----------------------------+----------------------------
       1 |        31439 |                  5 |      3551 | 2025-01-22 22:40:45.612281 | 2026-01-21 22:40:45.612281
       2 |        13235 |                  4 |      1492 | 2025-01-22 22:40:45.612281 | 2026-01-21 22:40:45.612281
...
(10 rows)

Time: 163.898 ms   -- ClickHouse
Time: 554.621 ms   -- Same query on Postgres
```

**Query 2: User engagement by country and platform**

This query joins events with users and computes engagement metrics:

```sql
-- Via ClickHouse
SELECT 
    u.country,
    u.platform,
    COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) as users,
    COUNT(*) as total_events,
    ROUND(COUNT(*)::numeric / COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id), 2) as events_per_user,
    SUM(CASE WHEN e.event_type = 'purchase' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as purchases
FROM organization.public_events e
JOIN organization.public_users u ON e.user_id = u.user_id
GROUP BY u.country, u.platform
ORDER BY total_events DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```text
 country | platform | users | total_events | events_per_user | purchases 
---------+----------+-------+--------------+-----------------+-----------
 USA     | Android  |   115 |       109977 |             956 |     12388
 USA     | Web      |   108 |       105057 |             972 |     11847
 USA     | iOS      |    83 |        84594 |            1019 |      9565
 Germany | Android  |    85 |        77966 |             917 |      8852
 India   | Android  |    80 |        68095 |             851 |      7724
...
(10 rows)

Time: 170.353 ms   -- ClickHouse
Time: 1245.560 ms  -- Same query on Postgres
```

**Performance comparison:**

| Query | Postgres (NVMe) | ClickHouse (via pg_clickhouse) | Speedup |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------|
| Top users (5 aggregations) | 555 ms | 164 ms | 3.4x |
| User engagement (JOIN + aggregations) | 1,246 ms | 170 ms | 7.3x |

:::tip When to use ClickHouse
Even on this 1M row dataset, ClickHouse delivers 3-7x faster performance on complex analytical queries with JOINs and multiple aggregations. The difference becomes even more dramatic at larger scales (100M+ rows), where ClickHouse's columnar storage and vectorized execution can deliver 10-100x speedups.

Query times vary based on instance size, network latency between services, data characteristics, and current load.

## Cleanup {#cleanup}

To delete the resources created in this quickstart:

1. First, delete the ClickPipe integration from the ClickHouse service
2. Then, delete the Managed Postgres instance from the Cloud Console
