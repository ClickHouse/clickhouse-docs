## Accessing connection details {#accessing-connection-details}

To connect your applications to Managed Postgres, navigate to the **Connect** view in the left sidebar of your instance.

<Image img={connectButton} alt="Click Connect in the left sidebar to view connection details" size="md" border/>

Clicking **Connect** opens a modal displaying your connection credentials and connection strings in multiple formats.

<Image img={connectModal} alt="Connection modal showing credentials and connection string formats" size="md" border/>

The connection modal displays the following information:

- **Username**: The database user (default: `postgres`)
- **Password**: Your database password (masked by default, click the eye icon to reveal)
- **Server**: The hostname for your Managed Postgres instance
- **Port**: The PostgreSQL port (default: `5432`)

Managed Postgres provides superuser access to your database. Use these credentials to connect as a superuser, which allows you to create additional users and manage database objects.

## Connection string formats {#connection-string}

The **Connect via** tabs provide your connection string in multiple formats to match your application's requirements:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **url** | Standard connection URL in the format `postgresql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE>` |
| **psql** | Ready-to-use command for connecting via the psql command line tool |
| **env** | Environment variables for libpq-based clients |
| **yaml** | YAML formatted configuration |
| **jdbc** | JDBC connection string for Java applications |

For security reasons, the password in connection strings is masked by default. Click the copy icon next to any field or connection string to copy it directly to your clipboard.

## PgBouncer connection pooling {#pgbouncer}

Managed Postgres includes a bundled [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) instance for server-side connection pooling. PgBouncer helps improve connection management, performance, and resource utilization, especially for applications that:

- Open many concurrent connections
- Frequently create and close connections
- Use serverless or ephemeral compute environments

To use connection pooling, click the **via PgBouncer** toggle at the top of the connection modal. The connection details will update to route your connections through the connection pooler instead of directly to PostgreSQL.

:::tip When to use PgBouncer
Use PgBouncer when your application opens many short-lived connections. For long-running connections or applications that use PostgreSQL features incompatible with connection pooling (like prepared statements across transactions), connect directly.

## TLS configuration {#tls}

All Managed Postgres instances are secured with TLS. The minimum supported version is **TLS 1.3**.

### Quick connection (TLS encrypted) {#quick-connection}

By default, connections use TLS encryption without certificate verification:

```bash
psql 'postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@your-instance.pg.clickhouse.cloud:5432/postgres'
```

### Verified TLS connection (recommended for production) {#verified-tls}

For production workloads, we recommend connecting with verified TLS to ensure you're communicating with the correct server. To do this, download the CA certificate bundle from the **Settings** tab and add it to your database client's trusted certificates.

The CA certificate is unique to your Managed Postgres instance and will not work with other instances.

To connect with a verified TLS connection, add `sslmode=verify-full` and the path to your downloaded certificate:

```bash
psql 'postgresql://postgres:PASSWORD@your-instance.pg.clickhouse.cloud:5432/postgres?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=/path/to/ca-certificate.pem'
```
