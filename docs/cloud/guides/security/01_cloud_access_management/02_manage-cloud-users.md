### Add users via SAML identity provider {#add-users-via-saml}

<EnterprisePlanFeatureBadge feature="SAML SSO"/>

If your organization is configured for [SAML SSO](/cloud/security/saml-setup), follow these steps to add users to your organization.

1. Add users to your SAML application in your identity provider. The users won't appear in ClickHouse until they have logged in once.
2. When the user logs in to ClickHouse Cloud, they will automatically be assigned the default role selected in your SAML configuration.
3. Follow the instructions in the `Manage user role assignments` below to grant permissions

### Enforcing SAML-only authentication {#enforce-saml}

Once you have at least one SAML user in the organization assigned to the Admin role, remove users with other authentication methods from the organization to enforce SAML only authentication for the organization.

## Manage user role assignments {#manage-role-assignments}

Users assigned the Admin role may update permissions for other users at any time.
