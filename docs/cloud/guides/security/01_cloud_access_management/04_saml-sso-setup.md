# SAML SSO setup

<EnterprisePlanFeatureBadge feature="SAML SSO"/>

ClickHouse Cloud supports single-sign on (SSO) via security assertion markup language (SAML). This enables you to sign in securely to your ClickHouse Cloud organization by authenticating with your identity provider (IdP).

We currently support service provider-initiated SSO SSO, multiple organizations using separate connections, and just-in-time provisioning. We do not yet support a system for cross-domain identity management (SCIM) or attribute mapping.

## Before you begin {#before-you-begin}

You will need Admin permissions in your IdP and the **Admin** role in your ClickHouse Cloud organization. After setting up your connection within your IdP, contact us with the information requested in the procedure below to complete the process.

We recommend setting up a **direct link to your organization** in addition to your SAML connection to simplify the login process. Each IdP handles this differently. Read on for how to do this for your IdP.

## How to configure your IdP {#how-to-configure-your-idp}

### Steps {#steps}

<details>
   <summary>  Get your organization ID  </summary>
   
   All setups require your organization ID. To obtain your organization ID:
   
   1. Sign in to your [ClickHouse Cloud](https://console.clickhouse.cloud) organization.
   
      <Image img={samlOrgId} size="md" alt="Organization ID" force/>
      
   3. In the lower left corner, click on your organization name under **Organization**.
   
   4. In the pop-up menu, select **Organization details**.
   
   5. Make note of your **Organization ID** to use below.
      
</details>

<details> 
   <summary>  Configure your SAML integration  </summary>
   
   ClickHouse uses service provider-initiated SAML connections. This means you can log in via https://console.clickhouse.cloud or via a direct link. We do not currently support identity provider initiated connections. Basic SAML configurations include the following:

- SSO URL or ACS URL:  `https://auth.clickhouse.cloud/login/callback?connection={organizationid}` 

- Audience URI or Entity ID: `urn:auth0:ch-production:{organizationid}` 

- Application username: `email`

- Attribute mapping: `email = user.email`

- Direct link to access your organization: `https://console.clickhouse.cloud/?connection={organizationid}` 

   For specific configuration steps, refer to your specific identity provider below.
   
</details>

<details>
   <summary>  Obtain your connection information  </summary>

   Obtain your Identity provider SSO URL and x.509 certificate. Refer to your specific identity provider below for instructions on how to retrieve this information.

</details>

<details>
   <summary>  Submit a support case </summary>
   
   1. Return to the ClickHouse Cloud console.
      
   2. Select **Help** on the left, then the Support submenu.
   
   3. Click **New case**.
   
   4. Enter the subject "SAML SSO Setup".
   
   5. In the description, paste any links gathered from the instructions above and attach the certificate to the ticket.
   
   6. Please also let us know which domains should be allowed for this connection (e.g. domain.com, domain.ai, etc.).
   
   7. Create a new case.
   
   8. We will complete the setup within ClickHouse Cloud and let you know when it's ready to test.

</details>

<details>
   <summary>  Complete the setup  </summary>

   1. Assign user access within your Identity Provider. 

   2. Log in to ClickHouse via https://console.clickhouse.cloud OR the direct link you configured in 'Configure your SAML integration' above. Users are initially assigned the 'Member' role, which can log in to the organization and update personal settings.

   3. Log out of the ClickHouse organization. 

   4. Log in with your original authentication method to assign the Admin role to your new SSO account.
- For email + password accounts, please use `https://console.clickhouse.cloud/?with=email`.
- For social logins, please click the appropriate button (**Continue with Google** or **Continue with Microsoft**)

:::note
`email` in `?with=email` above is the literal parameter value, not a placeholder
:::

   5. Log out with your original authentication method and log back in via https://console.clickhouse.cloud OR the direct link you configured in 'Configure your SAML integration' above.

   6. Remove any non-SAML users to enforce SAML for the organization. Going forward users are assigned via your Identity Provider.

## How it works {#how-it-works}

### User management with SAML SSO {#user-management-with-saml-sso}

For more information on managing user permissions and restricting access to only SAML connections, refer to [Manage cloud users](/cloud/security/manage-cloud-users).

### Service provider-initiated SSO {#service-provider-initiated-sso}

We only utilize service provider-initiated SSO. This means users go to `https://console.clickhouse.cloud` and enter their email address to be redirected to the IdP for authentication. Users already authenticated via your IdP can use the direct link to automatically log in to your organization without entering their email address at the login page.

### Multi-org SSO {#multi-org-sso}

ClickHouse Cloud supports multi-organization SSO by providing a separate connection for each organization. Use the direct link (`https://console.clickhouse.cloud/?connection={organizationid}`) to log in to each respective organization. Be sure to log out of one organization before logging into another.

## Additional information {#additional-information}

Security is our top priority when it comes to authentication. For this reason, we made a few decisions when implementing SSO that we need you to know.

- **We only process service provider-initiated authentication flows.** Users must navigate to `https://console.clickhouse.cloud` and enter an email address to be redirected to your identity provider. Instructions to add a bookmark application or shortcut are provided for your convenience so your users don't need to remember the URL.

- **We do not automatically link SSO and non-SSO accounts.** You may see multiple accounts for your users in your ClickHouse user list even if they are using the same email address.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues {#troubleshooting-common-issues}

| Error | Cause | Solution | 
|:------|:------|:---------|
| There could be a misconfiguration in the system or a service outage | Identity provider initiated login | To resolve this error try using the direct link `https://console.clickhouse.cloud/?connection={organizationid}`. Follow the instructions for your identity provider above to make this the default login method for your users | 
| You are directed to your identity provider, then back to the login page | The identity provider does not have the email attribute mapping |  Follow the instructions for your identity provider above to configure the user email attribute and log in again | 
| User is not assigned to this application | The user has not been assigned to the ClickHouse application in the identity provider | Assign the user to the application in the identity provider and log in again |
| You have multiple ClickHouse organizations integrated with SAML SSO and you are always logged into the same organization, regardless of which link or tile you use | You are still logged in to the first organization | Log out, then log in to the other organization |
| The URL briefly shows `access denied` | Your email domain does not match the domain we have configured | Reach out to support for assistance resolving this error |
