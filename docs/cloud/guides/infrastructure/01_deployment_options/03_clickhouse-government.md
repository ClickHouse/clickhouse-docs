## Overview {#overview}

ClickHouse Government is a self-deployed package consisting of the same proprietary version of ClickHouse that runs on ClickHouse Cloud and our ClickHouse Operator, configured for separation of compute and storage and hardened to meet the rigorous demands of government agencies and public sector organizations. It is deployed to Kubernetes environments with S3 compatible storage.

This package is currently available for AWS, with bare metal deployments coming soon.

:::note Note
ClickHouse Government is designed for government agencies, public sector organizations, or cloud software companies selling to these agencies and organizations, providing full control and management over their dedicated infrastructure. This option is only available by [contacting us](https://clickhouse.com/government).
