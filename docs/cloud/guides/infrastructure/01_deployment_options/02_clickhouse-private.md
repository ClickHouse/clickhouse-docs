## Overview {#overview}

ClickHouse Private is a self-deployed package consisting of the same proprietary version of ClickHouse that runs on ClickHouse Cloud and our ClickHouse Operator, configured for separation of compute and storage. It is deployed to Kubernetes environments with S3 compatible storage.

This package is currently available for AWS and IBM Cloud, with bare metal deployments coming soon.

:::note Note
ClickHouse Private is designed for large enterprises with the most rigorous compliance requirements, providing full control and management over their dedicated infrastructure. This option is only available by [contacting us](https://clickhouse.com/company/contact?loc=nav).
