While ClickHouse is known for its speed and reliability, optimal performance is 
achieved within certain operating parameters. For example, having too many tables,
databases, or parts can negatively impact performance. To prevent this, ClickHouse
Cloud enforces limits across several operational dimensions. 
The details of these guardrails are listed below.

:::tip
If you've run up against one of these guardrails, it's possible that you are 
implementing your use case in an unoptimized way. Contact our support team and 
we will gladly help you refine your use case to avoid exceeding the guardrails 
or look together at how we can increase them in a controlled manner.

:::note
For Single Replica Services, the maximum number of databases is restricted to 
100, and the maximum number of tables is restricted to 500. In addition, storage
for Basic Tier Services is limited to 1 TB.
