# ClickHouse Cloud tiers

There are several tiers available in ClickHouse Cloud. 
Tiers are assigned at any organizational level. Services within an organization therefore belong to the same tier.
This page discusses which tiers are right for your specific use case.

**Summary of cloud tiers:**

## Basic {#basic}

- Cost-effective option that supports single-replica deployments.
- Ideal for departmental use cases with smaller data volumes that do not have hard reliability guarantees.

:::note
Services in the basic tier are meant to be fixed in size and do not allow scaling, both automatic and manual. 
You can upgrade to the Scale or Enterprise tier to scale their services.
:::

## Scale {#scale}

Designed for workloads requiring enhanced SLAs (2+ replica deployments), scalability, and advanced security.

- Offers support for features such as: 
  - [Private networking support](/cloud/security/connectivity/private-networking).
  - [Compute-compute separation](../reference/warehouses#what-is-compute-compute-separation).
  - [Flexible scaling](/manage/scaling) options (scale up/down, in/out).
  - [Configurable backups](/cloud/manage/backups/configurable-backups)

## Enterprise {#enterprise}

Caters to large-scale, mission critical deployments that have stringent security and compliance needs.

- Everything in Scale, **plus**
- Flexible scaling: standard profiles (`1:4 vCPU:memory ratio`), as well as `HighMemory (1:8 ratio)` and `HighCPU (1:2 ratio)` custom profiles.
- Provides the highest levels of performance and resilience guarantees.
- Supports enterprise-grade security:
  - Single Sign On (SSO)
  - Enhanced Encryption: For AWS and GCP services. Services are encrypted by our key by default and can be rotated to their key to enable Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK).
- Allows Scheduled upgrades: you can select the day of the week/time window for upgrades, both database and cloud releases.  
- Offers [HIPAA](/cloud/security/compliance-overview#hipaa-since-2024) and PCI compliance.
- Exports Backups to the user's account.

:::note 
Single replica services across all three tiers are meant to be fixed in size (`8 GiB`, `12 GiB`)
:::

## Upgrading to a different tier {#upgrading-to-a-different-tier}

You can always upgrade from Basic to Scale or from Scale to Enterprise. Downgrading tiers will require disabling premium features.
