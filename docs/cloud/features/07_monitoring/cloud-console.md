# Monitoring in the ClickHouse Cloud Console

Services in ClickHouse Cloud come with out-of-the-box monitoring components that serve users with dashboards and notifications. By default, all users in the Cloud Console can access these dashboards.

## Dashboards {#dashboards}

### Service health {#service-health}

The Service Health dashboard can be used to monitor the high-level health of a service. ClickHouse Cloud scrapes and stores metrics displayed on this dashboard from system tables so they can be viewed when a service is idled.

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of Service Health dashboard */}

### Resource utilization {#resource-utilization}

The Infrastructure dashboard provides a detailed view of resources being used by the ClickHouse process. ClickHouse Cloud scrapes and stores metrics displayed on this dashboard from system tables so they can be viewed when a service is idled.

#### Memory and CPU {#memory-and-cpu}

The **Allocated CPU** and **Allocated Memory** graphs display the total compute resources available for each replica in your service. These allocations can be changed by using ClickHouse Cloud's [scaling features](/manage/scaling).

The **Memory Usage** and **CPU Usage** graphs estimate how much CPU and memory is actually being utilized by ClickHouse processes in each replica, including queries as well as background processes like merges.

:::note[Performance degradation]
If the memory or CPU utilization is approaching the allocated memory or CPU, you may begin to experience performance degradation. To resolve, we recommend:
- Optimizing your queries
- Changing the partitioning of your table engines
- Adding more compute resources to your service using [scaling](/manage/scaling)
:::

These are the corresponding system table metrics displayed on these graphs:

| Graph | Corresponding metric name | Aggregation | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Allocated memory | `CGroupMemoryTotal` | Max | |
| Allocated CPU | `CGroupMaxCPU` | Max | |
| Memory used | `MemoryResident` | Max | |
| CPU used | System CPU metric | Max | `ClickHouseServer_UsageCores` via Prometheus endpoint |

#### Data transfer {#data-transfer}

Graphs display data ingress and egress from ClickHouse Cloud. Learn more about [network data transfer](/cloud/manage/network-data-transfer).

### Advanced dashboard {#advanced-dashboard}

This dashboard is a modified version of the [built-in advanced observability dashboard](/cloud/manage/monitor/advanced-dashboard), with each series representing metrics per replica. This dashboard can be useful for monitoring and troubleshooting ClickHouse-specific issues.

<Image img={AdvancedDashboard} size="lg" alt="Advanced dashboard in ClickHouse Cloud" border/>

:::note
ClickHouse Cloud scrapes and stores metrics displayed on this dashboard from system tables so they can be viewed even when a service is idled. Accessing these metrics does not issue a query to the underlying service and will not wake idle services.
:::

The table below maps each graph in the Advanced Dashboard to its corresponding ClickHouse metric, system table source, and aggregation type:

| Graph | Corresponding ClickHouse metric name | System table | Aggregation Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Queries/sec | `ProfileEvent_Query` | `metric_log` | Sum / bucketSizeSeconds |

| Disk S3 write req/sec | `ProfileEvent_DiskS3PutObject` + `ProfileEvent_DiskS3UploadPart` + `ProfileEvent_DiskS3CreateMultipartUpload` + `ProfileEvent_DiskS3CompleteMultipartUpload` | `metric_log` | Sum / bucketSizeSeconds |
| Disk S3 read req/sec | `ProfileEvent_DiskS3GetObject` + `ProfileEvent_DiskS3HeadObject` + `ProfileEvent_DiskS3ListObjects` | `metric_log` | Sum / bucketSizeSeconds |
| FS cache hit rate | `sum(ProfileEvent_CachedReadBufferReadFromCacheBytes) / (sum(ProfileEvent_CachedReadBufferReadFromCacheBytes) + sum(ProfileEvent_CachedReadBufferReadFromSourceBytes))` | `metric_log` | |
| Page cache hit rate | `greatest(0, (sum(ProfileEvent_OSReadChars) - sum(ProfileEvent_OSReadBytes)) / (sum(ProfileEvent_OSReadChars) + sum(ProfileEvent_ReadBufferFromS3Bytes)))` | `metric_log` | |
| Network receive bytes/sec | `NetworkReceiveBytes` | `asynchronous_metric_log` | Sum / bucketSizeSeconds |
| Network send bytes/sec | `NetworkSendBytes` | `asynchronous_metric_log` | Sum / bucketSizeSeconds |
| Concurrent TCP connections | `CurrentMetric_TCPConnection` | `metric_log` | |
| Concurrent MySQL connections | `CurrentMetric_MySQLConnection` | `metric_log` | |
| Concurrent HTTP connections | `CurrentMetric_HTTPConnection` | `metric_log` | |

## Query insights {#query-insights}

The **Query Insights** feature makes ClickHouse's built-in query log easier to use through various visualizations and tables. ClickHouse's `system.query_log` table is a key source of information for query optimization, debugging, and monitoring overall cluster health and performance.

After selecting a service, the **Monitoring** navigation item in the left sidebar expands to reveal a **Query insights** sub-item:

<Image img={insights_overview} size="md" alt="Query Insights UI Overview" border/>

### Top-level metrics {#top-level-metrics}

The stat boxes at the top represent basic query metrics over the selected time period. Beneath them, time-series charts show query volume, latency, and error rate broken down by query kind (select, insert, other). The latency chart can be adjusted to display p50, p90, and p99 latencies:

<Image img={insights_latency} size="md" alt="Query Insights latency chart" border/>

### Recent queries {#recent-queries}

A table displays query log entries grouped by normalized query hash and user over the selected time window. Recent queries can be filtered and sorted by any available field, and the table can be configured to display or hide additional fields such as tables, p90, and p99 latencies:

<Image img={insights_recent} size="md" alt="Query Insights recent queries table" border/>

### Query drill-down {#query-drill-down}

Selecting a query from the recent queries table will open a flyout containing metrics and information specific to the selected query:

<Image img={insights_drilldown} size="md" alt="Query Insights UI Query Drill down" border/>

All metrics in the **Query info** tab are aggregated metrics, but we can also view metrics from individual runs by selecting the **Query history** tab:

<Image img={insights_query_info} size="sm" alt="Query Insights UI Query Information" border/>

From this pane, the `Settings` and `Profile Events` items for each query run can be expanded to reveal additional information.
