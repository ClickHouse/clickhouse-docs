## Payment thresholds {#threshholds}

If you are a pay as you go customer and your amount due in a billing period for ClickHouse Cloud reaches $10,000 USD or the equivalent value, your payment method configured to your organization will be automatically charged. 

:::tip
This default payment threshold amount can be adjusted below $10,000.
If you wish to do so, [contact support](support@clickhouse.com).
:::

A failed charge will result in the suspension of your services after a 14 day grace period.
If you receive multiple invoices within a billing period, all are due upon receipt and must be paid to keep your ClickHouse Cloud organization [compliant](/manage/clickhouse-cloud-billing-compliance).

If your automatic payment has a failed charge then it may be due to an issue with your configured credit card or that you have not set up an e-mandate on your credit card or your credit card is not compliant with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) framework for processing of e-mandates for recurring online transactions.
In case your credit cards are not RBI-complaint, you must add a new payment method that is RBI-compliant or continue making manual payments until you are able to set up the e-mandate on your card.

In the example below, the Billing UI in cloud console is shown:

As you can see from the above example - there was a threshold invoice sent during the Feb 28-March 31 billing period and then there is another invoice sent during the same billing period for the remaining usage over $10,000.

## Payment thresholds {#threshholds}

If your organization reaches 90% of the payment threshold and is on-track to exceed the payment threshold mid-period, the billing contact email associated with the organization will receive an email notification.
You will also receive an email notification as well as an invoice when you exceed the payment threshold.
