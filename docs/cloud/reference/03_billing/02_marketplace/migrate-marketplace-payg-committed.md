# Migrate billing from pay-as-you-go (PAYG) to a committed spend contract in a cloud marketplace {#migrate-payg-to-committed}

If your ClickHouse organization is currently billed through an active cloud marketplace pay-as-you-go (PAYG) subscription (or order) and you wish to migrate to billing via a committed spend contract through the same cloud marketplace, please accept your new offer and then follow the steps below based on your cloud service provider.

## Important Notes {#important-notes}

Please note that canceling your marketplace PAYG subscription does not delete your ClickHouse Cloud account - only the billing relationship via the marketplace. Once canceled, our system will stop billing for ClickHouse Cloud services through the marketplace. (Note: this process is not immediate and may take a few minutes to complete).

After your marketplace subscription is canceled, if your ClickHouse organization has a credit card on file, we will charge that card at the end of your billing cycle - unless a new marketplace subscription is attached beforehand.

If no credit card is configured after cancellation, you will have 14 days to add either a valid credit card or a new cloud marketplace subscription to your organization. If no payment method is configured within that period, your services will be suspended and your organization will be considered out of [billing compliance](/manage/clickhouse-cloud-billing-compliance).

Any usage accrued after the subscription is canceled will be billed to the next configured valid payment method - either a prepaid credit, a marketplace subscription, or credit card in that order.

For any questions or support with issues configuring your organization to a new marketplace subscription please reach out to ClickHouse [support](https://clickhouse.com/support/program) for help.
