Get started with ClickHouse Cloud on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) via a committed contract.
A committed contract, also known as a Private Offer, allows customers to commit to spending a certain amount on ClickHouse Cloud over a period of time.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- A Private Offer from ClickHouse based on specific contract terms.
- To connect a ClickHouse organization to your committed spend offer, you must be an admin of that organization.

:::note
One AWS account can only subscribe to one “ClickHouse Cloud - Committed Contract” private offer which can only be linked to one ClickHouse organization.
:::

Required permissions to view and accept your committed contract in AWS:

- If you use AWS managed policies, it is required to have the following permissions:
  - `AWSMarketplaceRead-only`, `AWSMarketplaceManageSubscriptions`
  - or `AWSMarketplaceFullAccess`
- If you aren't using AWS managed policies it is required to have the following permissions:
  - IAM action `aws-marketplace:ListPrivateListings` and `aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions`

## Steps to sign up {#steps-to-sign-up}

<VerticalStepper headerLevel="h3">

### Accept your private offer {#private-offer-accept}

You should have received an email with a link to review and accept your private offer.

### Review offer link {#review-offer-link}

Click on the Review Offer link in the email.
This should take you to your AWS Marketplace page with the private offer details.

### Set up your account {#setup-your-account}

Complete the steps to subscribe on the AWS portal and click on **"Set up your account"**.
It is critical to redirect to ClickHouse Cloud at this point and either register for a new account, or sign in with an existing account.
Without completing this step, we will not be able to link your AWS Marketplace contract to ClickHouse Cloud.

### Login to cloud {#login-cloud}

Once you redirect to ClickHouse Cloud, you can either login with an existing account, or register with a new account.
This step is necessary so that we can bind your ClickHouse Cloud organization to AWS Marketplace billing.

### Register if new {#register}

If you are a new ClickHouse Cloud user, click "Register" at the bottom of the page.
You will be prompted to create a new user and verify the email.
After verifying your email, you can leave the ClickHouse Cloud login page and login using the new username at [https://console.clickhouse.cloud](https://console.clickhouse.cloud).

Note that if you are a new user, you will also need to provide some basic information about your business.
See the screenshots below.

If you are an existing ClickHouse Cloud user, simply log in using your credentials.

### Create or select organization to bill {#create-select-org-to-bill}

After successfully logging in, you can decide whether to create a new organization to bill to this marketplace contract or choose an existing organization to bill to this contract.

After completing this step your organization will be connected to your AWS committed spend contract and all usage will be billed via your AWS account.
You can confirm from the organization's billing page in the ClickHouse UI that billing is indeed now linked to the AWS marketplace.
