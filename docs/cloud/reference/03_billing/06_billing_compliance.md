# ClickHouse cloud billing compliance

## Billing compliance {#billing-compliance}

Your use of ClickHouse Cloud requires your organization to have an active and
valid billing method configured. After your 30 day trial ends or your trial
credits are depleted, whichever occurs first, you have the following billing
options to continue using ClickHouse Cloud:

| Billing option                                       | Description                                                                             |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Direct PAYG](#direct-payg)                          | Add a valid credit card to your organization to Pay-As-You-Go                           |
| [Marketplace PAYG](#cloud-marketplace-payg)          | Set up a Pay-As-You-Go subscription via a supported cloud marketplace provider          |
| [Committed spend contract](#committed-spend-contract) | Enter into a committed spend contract directly or through a supported cloud marketplace |

If your trial ends and no billing option has been configured for your organization,
all your services will be stopped. If a billing method still hasn't been
configured after two weeks, all your data will be deleted.

ClickHouse charges for services at the organization level. If we're ever unable
to process a payment using your current billing method, you must update it to one
of the three options listed above to avoid service disruption. See below for more
details about payment compliance based on your chosen billing method.

### Pay-as-you-go billing with a credit card {#direct-payg}

You can pay for your ClickHouse Cloud usage monthly in arrears using a credit card.
To add a credit card, follow these [instructions](#add-credit-card).

Your monthly billing cycle for ClickHouse begins on the day the organization tier
(Basic, Scale, or Enterprise) is selected, and the first service is created within
the organization.

The credit card on file normally will be charged at the end of your monthly
billing cycle, but payment charges will be accelerated if the intracycle amount
due reaches $10,000 USD (more info on payment thresholds [here](/cloud/billing/payment-thresholds)).

The credit card on file must be valid, not expired, and have enough available
credit to cover your invoice total. If, for any reason, we're unable to charge
the full amount due, the following unpaid invoice restrictions will immediately
apply:

* You can only scale up to 120 GiB per replica
* You can't start your services if stopped
* You can't start or create new services

We will attempt to process payment using the organization's configured billing
method for up to 30 days. If payment isn't successful after 14 days, all services
within the organization will be stopped. If payment is still not received by the
end of this 30 day period and we've not granted an extension, all data and
services associated with your organization will be deleted.

### Cloud marketplace pay-as-you-go billing {#cloud-marketplace-payg}

Pay-As-You-Go billing can also be configured to charge an organization through one of our supported cloud marketplaces
(AWS, GCP, or Azure). To sign up for Marketplace PAYG billing, follow these
[instructions](#marketplace-payg).

Similar to billing via Direct PAYG, your monthly billing cycle with ClickHouse
under Marketplace PAYG begins on the day the organization tier (Basic, Scale,
or Enterprise) is selected and the first service is created within the
organization.

However, because of the requirements of the marketplaces, we report the charges
for your Pay-As-You-Go usage on an hour-by-hour basis. You will be
invoiced according to the terms of your agreement with that marketplace - typically
on a calendar-month billing cycle.

As an example, if you create your first organization service on January 18, your
first billing usage cycle in ClickHouse Cloud will run from January 18 until the
end of the day on February 17. However, you may receive your first invoice from
the cloud marketplace at the beginning of the month of February.

However, if your PAYG marketplace subscription is canceled or fails to renew
automatically, billing will fall back to the credit card on file for the
organization, if any. To add a credit card, [contact support](/about-us/support)
for help. If a valid credit card hasn't been provided, the same unpaid invoice
restrictions outlined above for [Direct PAYG](#direct-payg) will apply - this
includes service suspension and eventual data deletion.

### Committed contract billing {#committed-spend-contract}

You may purchase credits for your organization through a committed contract by:

1. Contacting sales to buy credits directly, with payment options including ACH
   or wire transfer. Payment terms will be set forth in the applicable order form.
2. Contacting sales to buy credits through a subscription on one of our supported
   cloud marketplaces (AWS, GCP, or Azure). Fees will be reported to the applicable
   marketplace upon acceptance of the private offer and thereafter in accordance
   with the offer terms, but you will be invoiced according to the terms of your
   agreement with that marketplace. To pay through a marketplace, follow these
   [instructions](#marketplace-payg).

Credits applied to an organization (e.g. through committed contracts or refunds) are
available for your use for the term specified in the order form or accepted private
offer.
Credits are consumed starting on the day credit was granted in billing periods
based on the date the first organization tier (Basic, Scale, or Enterprise) is
selected.

If an organization is **not** on a cloud marketplace committed contract and runs
out of credits or the credits expire, the organization will automatically switch
to Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) billing. In this case, we will attempt to process payment
using the credit card on file for the organization, if any.

If an organization **is** on a cloud marketplace committed contract and runs out
of credits, it will also automatically switch to PAYG billing via the same
marketplace for the remainder of the subscription. However, if the subscription
isn't renewed and expires, we will then attempt to process payment using the
credit card on file for the organization, if any.

In either scenario, if we're unable to charge the configured credit card, the
unpaid invoice restrictions outlined above for [Pay-as-you-go (PAYG)](#direct-payg)
billing with a credit card will apply—this includes the suspension of services.
For more details on moving from your committed contract to PAYG billing, refer to the “Overconsumption” section in our [Terms and Conditions](https://clickhouse.com/legal/agreements/terms-of-service).
However, for committed contract customers, we will contact you regarding any
unpaid invoices before initiating data deletion. Data isn't automatically
deleted after any period of time.

If you’d like to add additional credits before your existing ones expire or are
depleted, [contact us](https://clickhouse.com/company/contact).
