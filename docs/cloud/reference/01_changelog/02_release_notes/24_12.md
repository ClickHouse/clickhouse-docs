Relevant changes for ClickHouse Cloud services based on the v24.12 release.

## Backward incompatible changes {#backward-incompatible-changes}

- Functions `greatest` and `least` now ignore NULL input values, whereas they previously returned NULL if one of the arguments was NULL. For example, `SELECT greatest(1, 2, NULL)` now returns 2. This makes the behavior compatible with PostgreSQL. [#65519](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65519) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
- Don't allow Variant/Dynamic types in ORDER BY/GROUP BY/PARTITION BY/PRIMARY KEY by default because it may lead to unexpected results. [#69731](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69731) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
- Remove system tables `generate_series` and `generateSeries`. They were added by mistake here: [#59390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59390). [#71091](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71091) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Remove `StorageExternalDistributed`. Closes [#70600](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70600). [#71176](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71176) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
- Settings from server config (users.xml) now apply on the client too. Useful for format settings, e.g. `date_time_output_format`. [#71178](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71178) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
- Fix possible error `No such file or directory` due to unescaped special symbols in files for JSON subcolumns. [#71182](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71182) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
- The table engines Kafka, NATS and RabbitMQ are now covered by their own grants in the `SOURCES` hierarchy. Add grants to any non-default database users that create tables with these engine types. [#71250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71250) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
- Check the full mutation query before executing it (including subqueries). This prevents accidentally running an invalid query and building up dead mutations that block valid mutations. [#71300](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71300) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
- Rename filesystem cache setting `skip_download_if_exceeds_query_cache` to `filesystem_cache_skip_download_if_exceeds_per_query_cache_write_limit`. [#71578](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71578) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
- Forbid Dynamic/Variant types in min/max functions to avoid confusion. [#71761](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71761) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
- Remove support for `Enum` as well as `UInt128` and `UInt256` arguments in `deltaSumTimestamp`. Remove support for `Int8`, `UInt8`, `Int16`, and `UInt16` of the second ("timestamp") argument of `deltaSumTimestamp`. [#71790](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71790) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Added source query validation when ClickHouse is used as a source for a dictionary. [#72548](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72548) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).

## New features {#new-features}

- Implement SYSTEM LOAD PRIMARY KEY command to load primary indexes for all parts of a specified table or for all tables if no table is specified. This will be useful for benchmarks and to prevent extra latency during query execution. [#66252](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66252) ([ZAWA_ll](https://github.com/Zawa-ll)).
- Added statement `SYSTEM LOAD PRIMARY KEY` for loading the primary indexes of all parts in a specified table or for all tables if no table is specified. This can be useful for benchmarking and to prevent extra latency during query execution. [#67733](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67733) ([ZAWA_ll](https://github.com/Zawa-ll)).
- Add `CHECK GRANT` query to check whether the current user/role has been granted the specific privilege and whether the corresponding table/column exists in the memory. [#68885](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68885) ([Unalian](https://github.com/Unalian)).
- Added SQL syntax to describe workload and resource management. https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/operations/workload-scheduling. [#69187](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69187) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
- [The Iceberg data storage](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#file-system-operations) format provides the user with extensive options for modifying the schema of their table. In this pull request, reading a table in Iceberg format has been implemented, where the order of columns, column names, and simple type extensions have been changed. [#69445](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69445) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
- Allow each authentication method to have its own expiration date, remove from user entity. [#70090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70090) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
- Push external user roles from query originator to other nodes in cluster. Helpful when only originator has access to the external authenticator (like LDAP). [#70332](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70332) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
- Support alter from String to JSON. This PR also changes the serialization of JSON and Dynamic types to new version V2. Old version V1 can be still used by enabling setting `merge_tree_use_v1_object_and_dynamic_serialization` (can be used during upgrade to be able to rollback the version without issues). [#70442](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70442) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
- Add function `toUnixTimestamp64Second` which converts a `DateTime64` to a `Int64` value with fixed second precision, so we can support return negative value if date is before 00:00:00 UTC on Thursday, 1 January 1970. [#70597](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70597) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
- Add new setting `enforce_index_structure_match_on_partition_manipulation` to allow attach when source table's projections and secondary indices is a subset of those in the target table. Close [#70602](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70602). [#70603](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70603) ([zwy991114](https://github.com/zwy991114)).
- The output of function `cast` differs with Apache Spark which cause difference in gluten project, see https://github.com/apache/incubator-gluten/issues/7602 This PR adds Spark text output format support feature, default closed. [#70957](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70957) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).
- Added a new header type for S3 endpoints for user authentication (`access_header`). This allows to get some access header with the lowest priority, which will be overwritten with `access_key_id` from any other source (for example, a table schema or a named collection). [#71011](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71011) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
- Initial implementation of settings tiers. [#71145](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71145) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
- Add support for staleness clause in order by with fill operator. [#71151](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71151) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
- Implement simple CAST from Map/Tuple/Object to new JSON through serialization/deserialization from JSON string. [#71320](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71320) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
- Added aliases `anyRespectNulls`, `firstValueRespectNulls`, and `anyValueRespectNulls` for aggregation function `any`. Also added aliases `anyLastRespectNulls` and `lastValueRespectNulls` for aggregation function `anyLast`. This allows using more natural camel-case-only syntax rather than mixed camel-case/underscore syntax, for example: `SELECT anyLastRespectNullsStateIf` instead of `anyLast_respect_nullsStateIf`. [#71403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71403) ([Peter Nguyen](https://github.com/petern48)).
- Added the configuration `date_time_utc` parameter, enabling JSON log formatting to support UTC date-time in RFC 3339/ISO8601 format. [#71560](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71560) ([Ali](https://github.com/xogoodnow)).
- Added an option to select the side of the join that will act as the inner (build) table in the query plan. This is controlled by `query_plan_join_swap_table`, which can be set to `auto`. In this mode, ClickHouse will try to choose the table with the smallest number of rows. [#71577](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71577) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
- Optimized memory usage for values of index granularity if granularity is constant for part. Added an ability to always select constant granularity for part (setting `use_const_adaptive_granularity`), which helps to ensure that it is always optimized in memory. It helps in large workloads (trillions of rows in shared storage) to avoid constantly growing memory usage by metadata (values of index granularity) of data parts. [#71786](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71786) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
- Implement `allowed_feature_tier` as a global switch to disable all experimental / beta features. [#71841](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71841) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
- Add `iceberg[S3;HDFS;Azure]Cluster`, `deltaLakeCluster`, `hudiCluster` table functions. [#72045](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72045) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
- Add syntax `ALTER USER {ADD|MODIFY|DROP SETTING}`, `ALTER USER {ADD|DROP PROFILE}`, the same for `ALTER ROLE` and `ALTER PROFILE`. [#72050](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72050) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
- Added `arrayPrAUC` function, which calculates the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the Precision Recall curve. [#72073](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72073) ([Emmanuel](https://github.com/emmanuelsdias)).
- Added cache for primary index of `MergeTree` tables (can be enabled by table setting `use_primary_key_cache`). If lazy load and cache are enabled for primary index, it will be loaded to cache on demand (similar to mark cache) instead of keeping it in memory forever. Added prewarm of primary index on inserts/mergs/fetches of data parts and on restarts of table (can be enabled by setting `prewarm_primary_key_cache`). [#72102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72102) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
- Add indexOfAssumeSorted function for array types. Optimizes the search in the case of a sorted in non-decreasing order array. [#72517](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72517) ([Eric Kurbanov](https://github.com/erickurbanov)).
- Allows to use a delimiter as a optional second argument for aggregate function `groupConcat`. [#72540](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72540) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
- A new setting, `http_response_headers` which allows you to customize the HTTP response headers. For example, you can tell the browser to render a picture that is stored in the database. This closes [#59620](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59620). [#72656](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72656) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Add function `fromUnixTimestamp64Second` which converts a Int64 Unix timestamp value to a DateTime64. [#73146](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73146) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

## Performance improvements {#performance-improvements}

- Add 2 new settings `short_circuit_function_evaluation_for_nulls` and `short_circuit_function_evaluation_for_nulls_threshold` that allow to execute functions over `Nullable` columns in short-circuit manner when the ratio of NULL values in the block of data exceeds the specified threshold. It means that the function will be executed only on rows with non-null values. It applies only to functions that return NULL value for rows where at least one argument is NULL. [#60129](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/60129) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
- Memory usage of `clickhouse disks remove --recursive` is reduced for object storage disks. [#67323](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67323) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
- Now we won't copy input blocks columns for `join_algorithm='parallel_hash'` when distribute them between threads for parallel processing. [#67782](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67782) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
- Enable JIT compilation for more expressions: `abs`/`bitCount`/`sign`/`modulo`/`pmod`/`isNull`/`isNotNull`/`assumeNotNull`/`to(U)Int*`/`toFloat*`, comparison functions(`=`, `<`, `>`, `>=`, `<=`), logical functions(`and`, `or`). [#70598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70598) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
- Now `parallel_hash` algorithm will be used (if applicable) when `join_algorithm` setting is set to `default`. Two previous alternatives (`direct` and `hash`) are still considered when `parallel_hash` cannot be used. [#70788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70788) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
- Optimized `Replacing` merge algorithm for non intersecting parts. [#70977](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70977) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
- Do not list detached parts from readonly and write-once disks for metrics and system.detached_parts. [#71086](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71086) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Do not calculate heavy asynchronous metrics by default. The feature was introduced in [#40332](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/40332), but it isn't good to have a heavy background job that is needed for only a single customer. [#71087](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71087) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Improve the performance and accuracy of system.query_metric_log collection interval by reducing the critical region. [#71473](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71473) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).
- Add option to extract common expressions from `WHERE` and `ON` expressions in order to reduce the number of hash tables used during joins. Can be enabled by `optimize_extract_common_expressions = 1`. [#71537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71537) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
- Allows to use indexes on `SELECT` with `LowCardinality(String)`. [#71598](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71598) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
- During query execution with parallel replicas and enabled local plan, skip index analysis on workers. The coordinator will choose ranges to read for workers based on index analysis on its side (on query initiator). [#72109](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72109) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
- Bring back optimization for reading subcolumns of single column in Compact parts from https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57631. It was deleted accidentally. [#72285](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72285) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
- Speedup sorting of `LowCardinality(String)` columns by de-virtualizing calls in comparator. [#72337](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72337) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
- Optimize function argMin/Max for some simple data types. [#72350](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72350) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
- Optimize locking with shared locks in the memory tracker to reduce lock contention. [#72375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72375) ([Jiebin Sun](https://github.com/jiebinn)).
- Add a new setting, `use_async_executor_for_materialized_views`. Use async and potentially multithreaded execution of materialized view query, can speedup views processing during INSERT, but also consume more memory. [#72497](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72497) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
- Default values for settings `max_size_to_preallocate_for_aggregation`, `max_size_to_preallocate_for_joins` were further increased to `10^12`, so the optimisation will be applied in more cases. [#72555](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72555) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
- Improved performance of deserialization of states of aggregate functions (in data type `AggregateFunction` and in distributed queries). Slightly improved performance of parsing of format `RowBinary`. [#72818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72818) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

## Improvement {#improvement}

- Higher-order functions with constant arrays and constant captured arguments will return constants. [#58400](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/58400) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Read-in-order optimization via generating virtual rows, so less data would be read during merge sort especially useful when multiple parts exist. [#62125](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/62125) ([Shichao Jin](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
- Query plan step names (`EXPLAIN PLAN json=1`) and pipeline processor names (`EXPLAIN PIPELINE compact=0,graph=1`) now have a unique id as a suffix. This allows to match processors profiler output and OpenTelemetry traces with explain output. [#63518](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63518) ([qhsong](https://github.com/qhsong)).
- Added option to check object exists after writing to Azure Blob Storage, this is controlled by setting `check_objects_after_upload`. [#64847](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/64847) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
- Fix use-after-dtor logic in HashTable destroyElements. [#65279](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65279) ([cangyin](https://github.com/cangyin)).
- Use `Atomic` database by default in `clickhouse-local`. Address items 1 and 5 from [#50647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50647). Closes [#44817](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/44817). [#68024](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68024) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Write buffer has to be canceled or finalized explicitly. Exceptions break the HTTP protocol in order to alert the client about error. [#68800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68800) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
- Report running DDLWorker hosts by creating replica_dir and mark replicas active in DDLWorker. [#69658](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69658) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
- 1. Refactor `DDLQueryStatusSource`: - Rename `DDLQueryStatusSource` to `DistributedQueryStatusSource`, and make it a base class - Create two subclasses `DDLOnClusterQueryStatusSource` and `ReplicatedDatabaseQueryStatusSource` derived from `DDLQueryStatusSource` to query the status of DDL tasks from `DDL On Cluster and Replicated databases respectively. 2. Support stop waiting for offline hosts in `DDLOnClusterQueryStatusSource`. [#69660](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69660) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
- Adding a new cancellation logic: `CancellationChecker` checks timeouts for every started query and stops them once the timeout has reached. [#69880](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69880) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
- Remove the `allow_experimental_join_condition` setting, allowing non-equi conditions by default. [#69910](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69910) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
- Enable `parallel_replicas_local_plan` by default. Building a full-fledged local plan on the query initiator improves parallel replicas performance with less resource consumption, provides opportunities to apply more query optimizations. [#70171](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70171) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
- Add ability to set user/password in http_handlers (for `dynamic_query_handler`/`predefined_query_handler`). [#70725](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70725) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
- Support `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY/RESET SETTING ...` for certain settings in storage S3Queue. [#70811](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70811) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
- Do not call the object storage API when listing directories, as this may be cost-inefficient. Instead, store the list of filenames in the memory. The trade-offs are increased initial load time and memory required to store filenames. [#70823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70823) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
- Add `--threads` parameter to `clickhouse-compressor`, which allows to compress data in parallel. [#70860](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70860) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Make the Replxx client history size configurable. [#71014](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71014) ([Jiří Kozlovský](https://github.com/jirislav)).
- Added a setting `prewarm_mark_cache` which enables loading of marks to mark cache on inserts, merges, fetches of parts and on startup of the table. [#71053](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71053) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
- Boolean support for parquet native reader. [#71055](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71055) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
- Retry more errors when interacting with S3, such as "Malformed message". [#71088](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71088) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Lower log level for some messages about S3. [#71090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71090) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Support write hdfs files with space. [#71105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71105) ([exmy](https://github.com/exmy)).
- `system.session_log` is quite okay. This closes [#51760](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/51760). [#71150](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71150) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Fixes RIGHT / FULL joins in queries with parallel replicas. Now, RIGHT joins can be executed with parallel replicas (right table reading is distributed). FULL joins can't be parallelized among nodes, - executed locally. [#71162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71162) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
- Added settings limiting the number of replicated tables, dictionaries and views. [#71179](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71179) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
- Fixes [#71227](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71227). [#71286](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71286) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
- Automatic `GROUP BY`/`ORDER BY` to disk based on the server/user memory usage. Controlled with `max_bytes_ratio_before_external_group_by`/`max_bytes_ratio_before_external_sort` query settings. [#71406](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71406) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
- Add per host dashboards `Overview (host)` and `Cloud overview (host)` to advanced dashboard. [#71422](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71422) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
- Function `translate` now supports character deletion if the `from` argument contains more characters than the `to` argument. Example: `SELECT translate('clickhouse', 'clickhouse', 'CLICK')` now returns `CLICK`. [#71441](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71441) ([shuai.xu](https://github.com/shuai-xu)).
- Added new functions `parseDateTime64`, `parseDateTime64OrNull` and `parseDateTime64OrZero`. Compared to the existing function `parseDateTime` (and variants), they return a value of type `DateTime64` instead of `DateTime`. [#71581](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71581) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
- Shrink to fit index_granularity array in memory to reduce memory footprint for MergeTree table engines family. [#71595](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71595) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
- The command line applications will highlight syntax even for multi-statements. [#71622](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71622) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Command-line applications will return non-zero exit codes on errors. In previous versions, the `disks` application returned zero on errors, and other applications returned zero for errors 256 (`PARTITION_ALREADY_EXISTS`) and 512 (`SET_NON_GRANTED_ROLE`). [#71623](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71623) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- The `Vertical` format (which is also activated when you end your query with `\G`) gets the features of Pretty formats, such as: - highlighting thousand groups in numbers; - printing a readable number tip. [#71630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71630) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
- Allow to disable memory buffer increase for filesystem cache via setting `filesystem_cache_prefer_bigger_buffer_size`. [#71640](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71640) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
- Add a separate setting `background_download_max_file_segment_size` for background download max file segment size in filesystem cache. [#71648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71648) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
- Changes the default value of `enable_http_compression` from 0 to 1. Closes [#71591](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71591). [#71774](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71774) ([Peter Nguyen](https://github.com/petern48)).
- Support ALTER from Object to JSON. [#71784](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71784) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
- Slightly better JSON type parsing: if current block for the JSON path contains values of several types, try to choose the best type by trying types in special best-effort order. [#71785](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71785) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
- Previously reading from `system.asynchronous_metrics` would wait for concurrent update to finish. This can take long time if system is under heavy load. With this change the previously collected values can always be read. [#71798](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71798) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
- Set `polling_max_timeout_ms` to 10 minutes, `polling_backoff_ms` to 30 seconds. [#71817](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71817) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
- Queries like 'SELECT - FROM t LIMIT 1' used to load part indexes even though they were not used. [#71866](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71866) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
- Allow_reorder_prewhere_conditions is on by default with old compatibility settings. [#71867](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71867) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

- When retrieving data directly from a dictionary using Dictionary storage, dictionary table function, or direct SELECT from the dictionary itself, it is now enough to have `SELECT` permission or `dictGet` permission for the dictionary. This aligns with previous attempts to prevent ACL bypasses: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/57362 and https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65359. It also makes the latter one backward compatible. [#72051](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72051) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
- On the advanced dashboard HTML page added a dropdown selector for the dashboard from `system.dashboards` table. [#72081](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72081) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).

- The problem is [described here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72091). Azure Iceberg Writer creates Iceberg metadata files (as well as manifest files) that violate specs. In this PR I added an attempt to read v1 iceberg format metadata with v2 reader (cause they write it in a this way), and added error when they didn't create corresponding fields in a manifest file. [#72277](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72277) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
- Move JSON/Dynamic/Variant types from experimental features to beta. [#72294](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72294) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
- Now it's allowed to `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` with `UNION [ALL]` in query. Behavior is the same as for matview with `JOIN`: **only first table in `SELECT` expression will work as trigger for insert*- , all other tables will be ignored. [#72347](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72347) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
- Speed up insertions into merge tree in case of a single value of partition key inside inserted batch. [#72348](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72348) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
- Add the new MergeTreeIndexGranularityInternalArraysTotalSize metric to system.metrics. This metric is needed to find the instances with huge datasets susceptible to the high memory usage issue. [#72490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72490) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
- All spellings of word `Null` now recognised when query uses `Format Null`. Previously other forms (e.g. `NULL`) did not result in exceptions being thrown, but at the same time format `Null` wasn't actually used in those cases. [#72658](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72658) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
- Allow unknown values in set that are not present in Enum. Fix [#72662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72662). [#72686](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72686) ([zhanglistar](https://github.com/zhanglistar)).

[#72108](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72108) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
- Fix a bug where `min_age_to_force_merge_on_partition_only` was getting stuck trying to merge down the same partition repeatedly that was already merged to a single part and not merging partitions that had multiple parts.

- Dropping mark cache might take noticeable time if it is big. If we hold context mutex during this it block many other activities, even new client connection cannot be established until it is released. And holding this mutex is not actually required for synchronization, it is enough to have a local reference to the cache via shared ptr. [#72749](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72749) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
- PK cache was heavily underestimating it's size on one of the test instances. In particular LowCardinality columns were not including dictionary size. The fix is to use column->allocatedBytes() plus some more overhead estimates for cache entry size.
