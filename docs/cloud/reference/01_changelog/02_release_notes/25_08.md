## Backward incompatible changes {#backward-incompatible-changes}

### JSON and data format changes {#json-and-data-format-changes}

* Disable quoting 64 bit integers in JSON formats by default. [#74079](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74079) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Infer `Array(Dynamic)` instead of unnamed `Tuple` for arrays of values with different types in JSON. To use the previous behaviour, disable setting [`input_format_json_infer_array_of_dynamic_from_array_of_different_types`](/operations/settings/formats#input_format_json_infer_array_of_dynamic_from_array_of_different_types). [#80859](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80859) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Write values of `Enum` type as `BYTE_ARRAY` with `ENUM` logical type in Parquet output format by default. [#84169](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84169) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).

### Storage and partitioning {#storage-and-partitioning}

* Add support for hive partition style writes and refactor reads implementation (hive partition columns are no longer virtual). [#76802](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76802) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Enable MergeTree setting [`write_marks_for_substreams_in_compact_parts`](/operations/settings/merge-tree-settings#write_marks_for_substreams_in_compact_parts) by default. It significantly improves performance of subcolumns reading from newly created Compact parts. Servers with version less than 25.5 won't be able to read the new ompact parts. [#84171](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84171) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Disallow `RENAME COLUMN` or `DROP COLUMN` involving explicitly listed columns to sum in SummingMergeTree. Closes [#81836](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/81836). [#82821](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82821) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### Function enhancements {#function-enhancements}

* Introduce a new argument `unexpected_quoting_character_strategy` to the [`extractKeyValuePairs`](/sql-reference/functions/tuple-map-functions#extractkeyvaluepairs) function that controls what happens when a `quoting_character` is unexpectedly found. For more details see the docs for [`extractKeyValuePairs`](/sql-reference/functions/tuple-map-functions#extractkeyvaluepairs). [#80657](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80657) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Previously, the function [`countMatches`](/sql-reference/functions/string-search-functions#countMatches) would stop counting at the first empty match even if the pattern accepts it. To overcome this issue, `countMatches` now continues execution by advancing by a single character when an empty match occurs. Users who would like to retain the old behavior can enable setting `count_matches_stop_at_empty_match`. [#81676](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81676) ([Elmi Ahmadov](https://github.com/ahmadov)).

### Data type improvements {#data-type-improvements}

* Improve the precision of conversion from `Decimal` to `Float32`. Implement conversion from `Decimal` to `BFloat16`. Closes [#82660](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82660). [#82823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82823) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### Performance and resource management {#performance-and-resource-management}

* Previously, `BACKUP` queries, merges and mutations were not using server-wide throttlers for local (`max_local_read_bandwidth_for_server` and `max_local_write_bandwidth_for_server`) and remote (`max_remote_read_network_bandwidth_for_server` and `max_remote_write_network_bandwidth_for_server`) traffic, instead they were only throttled by dedicated server settings (`max_backup_bandwidth_for_server`, `max_mutations_bandwidth_for_server` and `max_merges_bandwidth_for_server`). Now, they use both types of throttlers simultaneously. [#81753](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81753) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Added a new setting [`cluster_function_process_archive_on_multiple_nodes`](/operations/settings/settings#cluster_function_process_archive_on_multiple_nodes) which increases performance of processing archives in cluster functions when set to true (by default). Should be set to `false` for compatibility and to avoid errors during upgrade to 25.7+ if using cluster functions with archives on earlier versions. [#82355](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82355) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* The previous [`concurrent_threads_scheduler`](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#concurrent_threads_scheduler) default value was `round_robin`, which proved unfair in the presence of a high number of single-threaded queries (e.g., `INSERT`s). This change makes a safer alternative `fair_round_robin` scheduler, the default. [#84747](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84747) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Lazy materialization is enabled only with the analyzer to avoid maintenance without the analyzer which can have some issues (for example, when using `indexHint()` in conditions). [#83791](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83791) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).

### Schema and SQL syntax {#schema-and-sql-syntax}

* Forbid the creation of a table without insertable columns. [#81835](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81835) ([Pervakov Grigorii](https://github.com/GrigoryPervakov)).
* Require backticks around identifiers with dots in default expressions to prevent them from being parsed as compound identifiers. [#83162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83162) ([Pervakov Grigorii](https://github.com/GrigoryPervakov)).
* Support PostgreSQL-style heredoc syntax: `$tag$ string contents... $tag$`, also known as dollar-quoted string literals. In previous versions, there were fewer restrictions on tags: they could contain arbitrary characters, including punctuation and whitespace. This introduces parsing ambiguity with identifiers that can also start with a dollar character. At the same time, PostgreSQL only allows word characters for tags. To resolve the problem, we now restrict heredoc tags only to contain word characters. Closes [#84731](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/84731). [#84846](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84846) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### Security and permissions {#security-and-permissions}

* `SYSTEM RESTART REPLICAS` will only restart replicas in the databases where you have permission to `SHOW TABLES`. Previously the query led to the wakeup of tables in the Lazy database, even without access to that database, while these tables were being concurrently dropped. [#83321](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83321) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Functions `azureBlobStorage`, `deltaLakeAzure`, and `icebergAzure` have been updated to properly validate `AZURE` permissions. All cluster-variant functions (`-Cluster` functions) now verify permissions against their corresponding non-clustered counterparts. Additionally, the `icebergLocal` and `deltaLakeLocal` functions now enforce `FILE` permission checks. [#84938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84938) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov

## New features {#new-feature}

### Data types {#data-types}

* Add new data types: [`Time`](/sql-reference/data-types/time) `([H]HH:MM:SS)` and [`Time64`](/sql-reference/data-types/time64) `([H]HH:MM:SS[.fractional])`, and some basic cast functions and functions to interact with other data types. Added settings for compatibility with a legacy function `ToTime`. [#81217](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81217) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).

### Functions {#functions}

* Add [`NumericIndexedVector`](/sql-reference/functions/numeric-indexed-vector-functions), a new vector data-structure backed by bit-sliced, roaring-bitmap compression, together with more than 20 functions for building, analysing and point-wise arithmetic. Can cut storage and speed up joins, filters and aggregations on sparse data. Implements [#70582](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70582) and ["Large-Scale Metric Computation in Online Controlled Experiment Platform" paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08411) by T.

[#81599](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81599) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Add the geospatial functions [`polygonIntersectsCartesian`](/sql-reference/functions/geo/polygons#polygonsintersectcartesian) and [`polygonIntersectsSpherical`](/sql-reference/functions/geo/polygons#polygonsintersectspherical) to check if two polygons intersect. [#81882](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81882) ([Paul Lamb](https://github.com/plamb)).
* Support [`lag`](/sql-reference/window-functions/lag) and [`lead`](/sql-reference/window-functions/lead) window functions. Closes [#9887](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/9887). [#82108](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82108) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Add functions [`colorSRGBToOkLCH`](/sql-reference/functions/other-functions#colorSRGBToOKLCH) and [`colorOkLCHToSRGB`](/sql-reference/functions/other-functions#colorOKLCHToSRGB) for converting colours between the sRGB and OkLCH colour spaces. [#83679](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83679) ([Fgrtue](https://github.com/Fgrtue)).
* Users can now do case-insensitive JSON key lookups using [`JSONExtractCaseInsensitive`](/sql-reference/functions/json-functions#JSONExtractCaseInsensitive) (and other variants of `JSONExtract`). [#83770](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83770) ([Alistair Evans](https://github.com/alistairjevans)).
* Add a new function [`nowInBlock64`](/sql-reference/functions/date-time-functions#nowInBlock64). [#84178](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84178) ([Halersson Paris](https://github.com/halersson)).
* Add function [`dateTimeToUUIDv7`](/sql-reference/functions/uuid-functions#dateTimeToUUIDv7) to convert a DateTime value to a UUIDv7. Example usage: `SELECT dateTimeToUUIDv7(toDateTime('2025-08-15 18:57:56'))` returns `0198af18-8320-7a7d-abd3-358db23b9d5c`. [#84319](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84319) ([samradovich](https://github.com/samradovich)).
* Add [`timeSeriesDerivToGrid`](/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference/timeSeriesDerivToGrid) and [`timeSeriesPredictLinearToGrid`](/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference/timeSeriesPredictLinearToGrid) aggregate functions to re-sample data to a time grid defined by the specified start timestamp, end timestamp, and step; calculates PromQL-like `deriv` and `predict_linear`, respectively. [#84328](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84328) ([Stephen Chi](https://github.com/stephchi0)).
* Add [`timeSeriesRange`](/sql-reference/functions/time-series-functions#timeSeriesRange) and [`timeSeriesFromGrid`](/sql-reference/functions/time-series-functions#timeSeriesFromGrid) functions. [#85435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85435) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).

### System tables {#system-tables}

* Add a [`system.dead_letter_queue`](/operations/system-tables/dead_letter_queue) table to keep erroneous incoming messages from engines like Kafka. [#68873](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/68873) ([Ilya Golshtein](https://github.com/ilejn)).
* Add [`system.zookeeper_connection_log`](/operations/system-tables/zookeeper_connection_log) system table to store historical information about ZooKeeper connections. [#79494](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/79494) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Added a new system table [`system.codecs`](/operations/system-tables/codecs) to introspect the available codecs. (issue [#81525](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/81525)). [#81600](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81600) ([Jimmy Aguilar Mena](https://github.com/Ergus)).
* Introduction of `system.completions` table. Closes [#81889](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/81889). [#83833](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83833) ([|2ustam](https://github.com/RuS2m)).

### Iceberg and DeltaLake {#iceberg-and-deltalake}

* Support complex types in iceberg schema evolution. [#73714](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73714) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Introduce Iceberg writes for `insert` queries. [#82692](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82692) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Support positional deletes for the Iceberg table engine. [#83094](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83094) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Read iceberg data files by field ids. Closes [#83065](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83065). [#83653](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83653) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Iceberg writes for create. Closes [#83927](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83927). [#83983](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83983) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Writes for Glue catalogs. [#84136](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84136) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Writes for Iceberg Rest catalogs. [#84684](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84684) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Merge all iceberg position delete files into data files. This will reduce amount and sizes of parquet files in iceberg storage. Syntax: `OPTIMIZE TABLE table_name`. [#85250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85250) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Support `DROP TABLE` for iceberg (Removing from REST/Glue catalogs + removing metadata about the table). [#85395](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85395) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Support `ALTER DELETE` mutations for iceberg in merge-on-read format. [#85549](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85549) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).

* Write more iceberg statistics (column sizes, lower and upper bounds) in metadata (manifest entries) for min-max pruning. [#85746](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85746) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Support add/drop/modify columns in iceberg for simple types. [#85769](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85769) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).

### MergeTree and storage {#mergetree-and-storage}

* All tables now support the `_table` virtual column, not only Merge type tables. [#63665](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63665) ([Xiaozhe Yu](https://github.com/wudidapaopao)).
* Add SZ3 as a lossy yet error-bounded compression codec for columns of type `Float32` and `Float64`. [#67161](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/67161) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Added support for lightweight updates for `MergeTree`-family tables. Lightweight updates can be used by a new syntax: `UPDATE <table> SET col1 = val1, col2 = val2, ... WHERE <condition>`. Added implementation of lightweight deletes via lightweight updates which can be enabled by setting `lightweight_delete_mode = 'lightweight_update'`. [#82004](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82004) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Support `_part_granule_offset` virtual column in MergeTree-family tables. This column indicates the zero-based index of the granule/mark each row belongs to within its data part. This addresses [#79572](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/79572). [#82341](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82341) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

### Protocol and client Support {#protocol-and-client-support}

* Implement support for [ArrowFlight RPC](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/Flight.html) protocol by adding the [`arrowflight`](/engines/table-engines/integrations/arrowflight) table engine. [#74184](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74184) ([zakr600](https://github.com/zakr600)).
* Add PostgreSQL protocol `COPY` command support. [#74344](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74344) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Support C# client for mysql protocol. This closes [#83992](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/83992). [#84397](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84397) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Force secure connection for `mysql_port` and `postgresql_port`. [#82962](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82962) ([Shaohua Wang](https://github.com/tiandiwonder)).

### SQL and query features {#sql-and-query-features}

* Support `DESCRIBE SELECT` in addition to `DESCRIBE (SELECT ...)`. [#82947](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82947) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Support writing `USE DATABASE {name}`. [#81307](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81307) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Reading from projections is implemented for parallel replicas. A new setting [`parallel_replicas_support_projection`](/operations/settings/settings#parallel_replicas_support_projection) has been added to control whether projection support is enabled. To simplify the implementation, support for projection is only enabled when `parallel_replicas_local_plan` is active. [#82807](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82807) ([zoomxi](https://github.com/zoomxi)).

### Formats {#formats}

* Add [`format_schema_source`](/operations/settings/formats#format_schema_source) setting which defines the source of `format_schema`. [#80874](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80874) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* Added `Hash` as a new output format. It calculates a single hash value for all columns and rows of the result. This is useful for calculating a "fingerprint" of the result, for example, in use cases where data transfer is a bottleneck. Example: `SELECT arrayJoin(['abc', 'def']), 42 FORMAT Hash` returns `e5f9e676db098fdb9530d2059d8c23ef`. [#84607](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84607) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

### Server configuration and workload management {#server-configuration-and-workload-management}

* Server setting [`cpu_slot_preemption`](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#cpu_slot_preemption) enables preemptive CPU scheduling for workloads and ensures max-min fair allocation of CPU time among workloads. New workload settings for CPU throttling are added: `max_cpus`, `max_cpu_share` and `max_burst_cpu_seconds`. [#80879](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80879) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* The workload setting [`max_waiting_queries`](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#max_waiting_queries) is now supported. It can be used to limit the size of the query queue. If the limit is reached, all subsequent queries will be terminated with the `SERVER_OVERLOADED` error. [#81250](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81250) ([Oleg Doronin](https://github.com/dorooleg)).
* Drop TCP connection after configured number of queries or time threshold. Resolves [#68000](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68000). [#81472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81472) ([Kenny Sun](https://github.com/hwabis)).

### Cloud storage {#cloud-storage}

* Add `extra_credentials` to `AzureBlobStorage` to authenticate with `client_id` and `tenant_id`. [#84235](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84235) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).

### Keeper {#keeper}

* Add the ability to set up arbitrary watches in Keeper Multi queries. [#84964](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84964) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
* Support partially aggregated metrics. [#85328](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85328) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).

## Experimental features {#experimental-features}

### Table engines and table functions {#table-engines-and-table-functions}

* Add Ytsaurus table engine and table function. [#77606](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77606) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).

### Text index improvements {#text-index-improvements}

* Add functions `searchAny` and `searchAll` which are general purpose tools to search text indexes. [#80641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80641) ([Elmi Ahmadov](https://github.com/ahmadov)).
* The text index now supports `string` tokenizer. [#81752](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81752) ([Elmi Ahmadov](https://github.com/ahmadov)).
* Changed the default index granularity value for `text` indexes to 64. This improves the expected performance for the average test query in internal benchmarks. [#82162](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82162) ([Jimmy Aguilar Mena](https://github.com/Ergus)).
* The 256-bit bitmap stores the outgoing labels of a state ordered, but outgoing states are saved into disk in the order they appear in the hash table. Therefore, a label would point to a wrong next state while reading from disk. [#82783](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82783) ([Elmi Ahmadov](https://github.com/ahmadov)).
* Currently, FST tree is saved into disk uncompressed. This could lead to slow performance or higher I/O bandwidth while both writing and reading into/from disk. [#83093](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83093) ([Elmi Ahmadov](https://github.com/ahmadov)).

### Feature maturity updates {#feature-maturity-updates}

* Moved catalog to beta. [#85848](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85848) ([Melvyn Peignon](https://github.com/melvynator)).
* Lightweight updates moved to the beta stage from experimental. [#85952](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85952) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

## Performance improvements {#performance-improvements}

### Query execution and aggregation {#query-execution-and-aggregation}

* Trivial optimization for `-If` aggregate function combinator. [#78454](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78454) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Added new logic (controlled by the setting [`enable_producing_buckets_out_of_order_in_aggregation`](/operations/settings/settings#enable_producing_buckets_out_of_order_in_aggregation), enabled by default) that allows sending some buckets out of order during memory-efficient aggregation. When some aggregation buckets take significantly longer to merge than others, it improves performance by allowing the initiator to merge buckets with higher bucket id-s in the meantime. The downside is potentially higher memory usage (shouldn't be significant). [#80179](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80179) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Make the pipeline after the `TOTALS` step multithreaded. [#80331](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80331) ([UnamedRus](https://github.com/UnamedRus)).
* When the aggregation query contains only a single `COUNT()` function on a `NOT NULL` column, the aggregation logic is fully inlined during hash table probing. This avoids allocating and maintaining any aggregation state, significantly reducing memory usage and CPU overhead. This partially addresses [#81982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/81982). [#82104](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82104) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Calculate serialized key columnarly when group by multiple string or number columns. [#83884](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83884) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Implement `addManyDefaults` for `-If` combinators. [#83870](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83870) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

### JOIN optimizations {#join-optimizations}

* Add new setting [`min_joined_block_size_rows`](/operations/settings/settings#min_joined_block_size_rows) (analogous to `min_joined_block_size_bytes`; defaults to 65409) to control the minimum block size (in rows) for JOIN input and output blocks (if the join algorithm supports it). Small blocks will be squashed. [#81886](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81886) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Performance of `HashJoin` optimised by removing the additional loop over hash maps in the typical case of only one key column, also `null_map` and `join_mask` checks are eliminated when they're always `true`/`false`. [#82308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82308) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* The optimizations for `null_map` and `JoinMask` from [#82308](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82308) were applied to the case of JOIN with multiple disjuncts. Also, the `KnownRowsHolder` data structure was optimized. [#83041](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83041) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Plain `std::vector<std::atomic_bool>` is used for join flags to avoid calculating a hash on each access to flags. [#83043](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83043) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Process `max_joined_block_rows` outside of hash JOIN main loop. Slightly better performance for ALL JOIN. [#83216](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83216) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Don't pre-allocate memory for result columns beforehand when `HashJoin` uses `lazy` output mode. It is suboptimal, especially when the number of matches is low. Moreover, we know the exact amount of matches after joining is done, so we can preallocate more precisely. [#83304](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83304) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* All `LEFT/INNER` JOINs will be automatically converted to `RightAny` if the right side is functionally determined by the join key columns (all rows have unique join key values). [#84010](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84010) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Improved performance of applying patch parts in `Join` mode. [#85040](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85040) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

### Distributed query improvements {#distributed-query-improvements}

* Introduced an option to offload (de)compression and (de)serialization of blocks into pipeline threads instead of a single thread associated with a network connection. Controlled by the setting `enable_parallel_blocks_marshalling`. It should speed up distributed queries that transfer significant amounts of data between the initiator and remote nodes. [#78694](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/78694) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Parallel distributed `INSERT SELECT` is enabled by default in mode where `INSERT SELECT` executed on each shard independently, see `parallel_distributed_insert_select` setting. [#80425](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80425) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Compress logs and profile events in the native protocol. On clusters with 100+ replicas, uncompressed profile events take 1..10 MB/sec, and the progress bar is sluggish on slow Internet connections. This closes [#82533](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82533). [#82535](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82535) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Parallel distributed `INSERT SELECT` is enabled by default in mode where INSERT SELECT executed on each shard independently, see `parallel_distributed_insert_select` setting. [#83040](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83040) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Fixed the calculation of the minimal task size for parallel replicas. [#84752](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84752) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).

### Index improvements {#index-improvements}

* Vector search queries using a vector similarity index complete with lower latency due to reduced storage reads and reduced CPU usage. [#79103](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/79103) ([Shankar Iyer](https://github.com/shankar-iyer)).
* Respect `merge_tree_min_{rows,bytes}_for_seek` in `filterPartsByQueryConditionCache` to align it with other methods filtering by indexes. [#80312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80312) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Process higher granularity min-max indexes first. Closes [#75381](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75381). [#83798](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83798) ([Maruth Goyal](https://github.com/maruthgoyal)).
* The bloom filter index is now used for conditions like `has([c1, c2, ...], column)`, where `column` is not of an `Array` type. This improves performance for such queries, making them as efficient as the `IN` operator. [#83945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83945) ([Doron David](https://github.com/dorki)).
* Processes indexes in increasing order of file size. The net index ordering prioritizes minmax and vector indexes (due to simplicity and selectivity respectively), and small indexes thereafter. Within the minmax/vector indexes smaller indexes are also preferred. [#84094](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84094) ([Maruth Goyal](https://github.com/maruthgoyal)).
* Previously, the text index data would be separated into multiple segments (each segment size by default was 256 MiB). This might reduce the memory consumption while building the text index, however this increases the space requirement on the disk and increase the query response time. [#84590](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84590) ([Elmi Ahmadov](https://github.com/ahmadov)).

### Subquery optimizations {#subquery-optimizations}

* Optimize the generated plan for correlated subqueries by removing redundant `JOIN` operations using equivalence classes. If there are equivalent expressions for all correlated columns, `CROSS JOIN` is not produced if `query_plan_correlated_subqueries_use_substitution` setting is enabled. [#82435](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82435) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Read only required columns in correlated subquery when it appears to be an argument of function `EXISTS`. [#82443](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82443) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).

### Azure Blob Storage improvements {#azure-blob-storage-improvements}

* [`azureBlobStorage`](/engines/table-engines/integrations/azureBlobStorage) table engine now cachees and reuses managed identity authentication tokens when possible to avoid throttling. [#79860](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/79860) ([Nick Blakely](https://github.com/niblak)).
* Replace curl HTTP client with poco HTTP client for azure blob storage. Introduced multiple settings for these clients which mirror settings from S3. Introduced aggressive connect timeouts for both Azure and S3. Improved introspection into Azure profile events and metrics. New client is enabled by default, provide much better latencies for cold queries on top of Azure Blob Storage. Old `Curl` client can be returned back by setting `azure_sdk_use_native_client=false`. [#83294](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83294) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).

### Storage engine improvements {#storage-engine-improvements}

* Fix filter by key for Redis and KeeperMap storages. [#81833](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81833) ([Pervakov Grigorii](https://github.com/GrigoryPervakov)).
* `ATTACH PARTITION` no longer leads to the dropping of all caches. [#82377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82377) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Avoid holding the lock while creating storage snapshot data to reduce lock contention with high concurrent load. [#83510](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83510) ([Duc Canh Le](https://github.com/canhld94)).
* Removing temporary parts may take a while (especially with S3), and currently we do it while holding a global lock in `MergeTreeBackgroundExecutor`. When we need to restart all tables due to connection loss and we wait for background tasks to finish - tables may even stuck in readonly mode for an hour. But looks like we don't need this lock for calling `cancel`. [#84311](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84311) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).

### Format improvements {#format-improvements}

* New parquet reader implementation. It's generally faster and supports page-level filter pushdown and `PREWHERE`. Currently experimental. Use setting `input_format_parquet_use_native_reader_v3` to enable. [#82789](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82789) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Improved performance of the ProtobufSingle input format by reusing the serializer when no parsing errors occur. [#83613](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83613) ([Eduard Karacharov](https://github.com/korowa)).

### Data type and serialization optimizations {#data-type-and-serialization-optimizations}

* Significantly improve performance of `JSON` subcolumns reading from shared data in MergeTree by implementing new serializations for `JSON` shared data in MergeTree. [#83777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83777) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Optimize string deserialization by simplifying the code. Closes [#38564](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38564). [#84561](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84561) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### Pipeline and execution improvements {#pipeline-and-execution-improvements}

* Minimize memory copy in port headers during pipeline construction. Original [PR](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70105) by [heymind](https://github.com/heymind). [#83381](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83381) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improve the performance of pipeline building. [#83631](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83631) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Optimize MergeTreeReadersChain::getSampleBlock. [#83875](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83875) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Optimize the materialization of constants in cases when we do this materialization only to return a single row. [#85071](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85071) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### Memory and resource optimizations {#memory-and-resource-optimizations}

* Tweak some jemalloc configs to improve performance. [#81807](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81807) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add alignment in the Counter of ProfileEvents to reduce false sharing. [#82697](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82697) ([Jiebin Sun](https://github.com/jiebinn)).
* Reduce unnecessary memcpy calls in CompressedReadBufferBase::readCompressedData. [#83986](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83986) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

### Query planning and analysis {#query-planning-and-analysis}

* Speedup of QueryTreeHash. [#82617](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82617) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

### Logging improvements {#logging-improvements}

* Introduce async logging. [#82516](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82516) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).

### Function optimizations {#function-optimizations}

* Optimize `largestTriangleThreeBuckets` by removing temporary data. [#84479](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84479) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Optimized and simplified implementation of many string-handling functions. Corrected incorrect documentation for several functions. Note: The output of `byteSize` for String columns and complex types containing String columns has changed from 9 bytes per empty string to 8 bytes per empty string, which is expected behavior. [#85063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85063) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

### Keeper improvements {#keeper-improvements}

* Improve Keeper with rocksdb initial loading. [#83390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83390) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).

### Data lake improvements {#data-lake-improvements}

* Improve parallel files processing with delta-kernel-rs backend. [#85642](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85642) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

## Improvements {#improvements}

### Access control and security {#access-control-and-security}

* Introduced two new access types: `READ` and `WRITE` for sources and deprecates all previous access types related to sources. Before `GRANT S3 ON *.* TO user`, now: `GRANT READ, WRITE ON S3 TO user`. This also allows to separate `READ` and `WRITE` permissions for sources, e.g.: `GRANT READ ON * TO user`, `GRANT WRITE ON S3 TO user`. The feature is controlled by a setting `access_control_improvements.enable_read_write_grants` and disabled by default. [#73659](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73659) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Allow parameters in `CREATE USER` queries for usernames. [#81387](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81387) ([Diskein](https://github.com/Diskein)).
* Exclude sensitive data from core dumps. Add two allocators: AWS library compatible `AwsNodumpMemoryManager` and STL compatible `JemallocNodumpSTLAllocator`. Both are wrappers of the Jemalloc allocator. They use Jemalloc's extent hooks and madvise to mark memory pages as "don't dump". Used for S3 credentials, user credentials, and some query data. [#82441](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82441) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Views, created by ephemeral users, will now store a copy of an actual user and will no longer be invalidated after the ephemeral user is deleted. [#84763](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84763) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Match external auth forward_headers in case-insensitive way. [#84737](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84737) ([ingodwerust](https://github.com/ingodwerust)).
* Add a `parameter` column to `system.grants` to determine source type for `GRANT READ/WRITE` and the table engine for `GRANT TABLE ENGINE`. [#85643](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85643) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).

### Backup and restore {#backup-and-restore}

* Allow backups for PostgreSQL, MySQL & DataLake databases. A backup of such a database would only save the definition and not the data inside of it. [#79982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/79982) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Set all log messages for writing backup files to TRACE. [#82907](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82907) ([Hans Krutzer](https://github.com/hkrutzer)).
* Introduce [`backup_restore_s3_retry_initial_backoff_ms`](/operations/settings/settings#backup_restore_s3_retry_initial_backoff_ms), [`backup_restore_s3_retry_max_backoff_ms`](/operations/settings/settings#backup_restore_s3_retry_max_backoff_ms), [`backup_restore_s3_retry_jitter_factor`](/operations/settings/settings#backup_restore_s3_retry_jitter_factor) to configure the S3 retry backoff strategy used during backup and restore operations. [#84421](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84421) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* Introduce a new [`backup_slow_all_threads_after_retryable_s3_error`](/operations/settings/settings#backup_slow_all_threads_after_retryable_s3_error) setting to reduce pressure on S3 during retry storms caused by errors such as `SlowDown`, by slowing down all threads once a single retryable error is observed. [#84854](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84854) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).

### Data integrity and validation {#data-integrity-and-validation}

* Verify the part has consistent checksum.txt file right before committing it. [#76625](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76625) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* Forbid to start `RENAME COLUMN` alter mutation if it will rename some column that right now affected by incomplete data mutation. [#81823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81823) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
* Now mutations snapshot will be built from the snapshot of visible parts. Mutation counters used in snapshot will also be recalculated from the included mutations. [#82945](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82945) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
* Add ability to parse part's prefix and suffix and also check coverage for non constant columns. [#83377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83377) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).

### Iceberg table engine {#iceberg-table-engine}

* Support position deletes for Iceberg table engine. [#80237](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80237) ([YanghongZhong](https://github.com/yahoNanJing)).
* Now clickhouse supports compressed `metadata.json` files for Iceberg. Fixes [#70874](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70874). [#81451](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81451) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Fix iceberg reading by field ids for complex types. [#84821](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84821) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Support iceberg writes to read from pyiceberg. [#84466](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84466) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Adds snapshot version to data lake table engines. [#84659](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84659) ([Pete Hampton](https://github.com/pjhampton)).
* Support writing of a version-hint file with Iceberg. This closes [#85097](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/85097). [#85130](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85130) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Support compressed `.metadata.json` file via [`iceberg_metadata_compression_method`](/operations/settings/settings#iceberg_metadata_compression_method) setting. It supports all clickhouse compression methods. This closes [#84895](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/84895). [#85196](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85196) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Optimized memory usage for Iceberg positional delete files. Instead of loading all delete file data into memory, only the current row-group from Parquet delete files is kept in RAM. This significantly reduces memory consumption when working with large positional delete files. [#85329](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85329) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Allow asynchronously iterating objects from Iceberg table without storing objects for each data file explicitly. [#85369](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85369) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Support Iceberg equality deletes. [#85843](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85843) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).

### DeltaLake table engine {#deltalake-table-engine}

* Improve `DeltaLake` table engine: delta-kernel-rs has `ExpressionVisitor` API which is implemented in this PR and is applied to partition column expressions transform (it will replace an old deprecated within the delta-kernel-rs way, which was used before in our code). In the future this `ExpressionVisitor` will also allow to implement statistics based pruning and some delta-lake proprietary features. Additionally the purpose of this change is to support partition pruning in `DeltaLakeCluster` table engine (the result of a parsed expression - ActionsDAG - will be serialized and sent from the initiator along with the data path, because this kind of information, which is needed for pruning, is only available as meta information on data files listing, which is done by initiator only, but it has to be applied to data on each reading server). [#81136](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81136) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fix partition pruning with data lake cluster functions. [#82131](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82131) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fix reading partitioned data in DeltaLakeCluster table function. In this PR cluster functions protocol version is increased, allowing to send extra info from initiator to replicas. This extra info contains delta-kernel transform expression, which is needed to parse partition columns (and some other staff in the future, like generated columns, etc). [#82132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82132) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Now database Datalake throw more convenient exception. Fixes [#81211](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/81211). [#82304](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82304) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Implement internal `delta-kernel-rs` filtering (statistics and partition pruning) in storage `DeltaLake`. [#84006](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84006) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add a setting [`delta_lake_enable_expression_visitor_logging`](/operations/settings/settings#delta_lake_enable_expression_visitor_logging) to turn off expression visitor logs as they can be too verbose even for test log level when debugging something. [#84315](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84315) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add setting [`delta_lake_snapshot_version`](/operations/settings/settings#delta_lake_snapshot_version) to allow reading specific snapshot version in table engine `DeltaLake`. [#85295](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85295) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

### Data lake integration {#data-lake-integration}

* Speedup tables listing in data catalogs by asynchronous requests. [#81084](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81084) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Support `TimestampTZ` in Glue catalog. This closes [#81654](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/81654). [#83132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83132) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Splits FormatParserGroup on two independent structs, the first one is responsible for shared compute and IO resources, the second one is responsible for shared filter resources (filter ActionDag, KeyCondition). This is done for more flexible shared usage of these structures by different threads. [#83997](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83997) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Add missing `partition_columns_in_data_file` to azure configuration. [#85373](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85373) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Add show_data_lake_catalogs_in_system_tables flag to manage adding data lake tables in system.tables resolves [#85384](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/85384). [#85411](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85411) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).

### S3 and object storage {#s3-and-object-storage}

* Implement methods `moveFile` and `replaceFile` in `s3_plain_rewritable` to support it as a database disk. [#79424](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/79424) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* S3 read and write requests are throttled on the HTTP socket level (instead of whole S3 requests) to avoid issues with `max_remote_read_network_bandwidth_for_server` and `max_remote_write_network_bandwidth_for_server` throttling. [#81837](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81837) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* This PR introduces jitter to the S3 retry mechanism when the `s3_slow_all_threads_after_network_error` configuration is enabled. [#81849](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81849) ([zoomxi](https://github.com/zoomxi)).
* Implement AWS S3 authentication with an explicitly provided IAM role. Implement OAuth for GCS. These features were recently only available in ClickHouse Cloud and are now open-sourced. Synchronize some interfaces such as serialization of the connection parameters for object storages. [#84011](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84011) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow to use any storage policy (i.e. object storage, such as S3) for external aggregation/sorting. [#84734](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84734) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Collect all removed objects to execute single object storage remove operation. [#85316](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85316) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).

### S3Queue table engine {#s3queue-table-engine}

* Macros like `{uuid}` can now be used in the `keeper_path` setting of the S3Queue table engine. [#82463](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82463) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Add a new server setting `s3queue_disable_streaming` which disables streaming in tables with S3Queue table engine. This setting is changeable without server restart. [#82515](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82515) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add columns `commit_time`, `commit_id` to `system.s3queue_log`. [#83016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83016) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add logs for s3queue shutdown process. [#83163](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83163) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Shutdown S3(Azure/etc)Queue streaming before shutting down any tables on server shutdown. [#83530](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83530) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Support changing mv insert settings on `S3Queue` table level. Added new `S3Queue` level settings: `min_insert_block_size_rows_for_materialized_views` and `min_insert_block_size_bytes_for_materialized_views`. By default profile level settings will be used and `S3Queue` level settings will override those. [#83971](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83971) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* S3Queue ordered mode fix: quit earlier if shutdown was called. [#84463](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84463) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

### Kafka integration {#kafka-integration}

* Count consumed messages manually to avoid depending on previous committed offset in StorageKafka2. [#81662](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81662) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Integrate `StorageKafka2` to [`system.kafka_consumers`](/operations/system-tables/kafka_consumers). [#82652](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82652) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).

### ClickHouse Keeper improvements {#clickhouse-keeper-improvements}

* Keeper improvement: move changelog files between disk in a background thread. Previously, moving changelog to a different disk would block Keeper globally until the move is finished. This lead to performance degradation if moving is a long operation (e.g. to S3 disk). [#82485](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82485) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Keeper improvement: add new config `keeper_server.cleanup_old_and_ignore_new_acl`. If enabled, all nodes will have their ACLs cleared while ACL for new requests will be ignored. If the goal is to completely remove ACL from nodes, it's important to leave the config enabled until a new snapshot is created. [#82496](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82496) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Keeper improvement: support specific permissions for world:anyone ACL. [#82755](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82755) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add support for specifying extra Keeper ACL for paths in config. If you want to add extra ACL for a specific path you define it in the config under `zookeeper.path_acls`. [#82898](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82898) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Adds ProfileEvent when Keeper rejects a write due to soft memory limit. [#82963](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82963) ([Xander Garbett](https://github.com/Garbett1)).
* Enable `create_if_not_exists`, `check_not_exists`, `remove_recursive` feature flags in Keeper by default which enable new types of requests. [#83488](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83488) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add support for applying extra ACL on specific Keeper nodes using `apply_to_children` config. [#84137](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84137) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add `get_acl` command to KeeperClient. [#84641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84641) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Add 4LW in Keeper, `lgrq`, for toggling request logging of received requests. [#84719](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84719) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Reduce contention on storage lock in Keeper. [#84732](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84732) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* The `encrypt_decrypt` tool now supports encrypted ZooKeeper connections. [#84764](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84764) ([Roman Vasin](https://github.com/rvasin)).
* Limit Keeper log entry cache size by number of entries using `keeper_server.coordination_settings.latest_logs_cache_entry_count_threshold` and `keeper_server.coordination_settings.commit_logs_cache_entry_count_threshold`. [#84877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84877) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).

### JSON and Dynamic types {#json-and-dynamic-types}

* Add `columns_substreams.txt` file to Wide part to track all substreams stored in the part. It helps to track dynamic streams in JSON and Dynamic types and so avoid reading sample of these columns to get the list of dynamic streams (for example for columns sizes calculation). Also now all dynamic streams are reflected in `system.parts_columns`. [#81091](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81091) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow `ALTER UPDATE` in JSON and Dynamic columns. [#82419](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82419) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Users can now use `Time` and `Time64` types inside the JSON type. [#83784](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83784) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Add a setting `json_type_escape_dots_in_keys` to escape dots in JSON keys during JSON type parsing. The setting is disabled by default. [#84207](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84207) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).

### Parquet and ORC formats {#parquet-and-orc-formats}

* Introduce settings to set ORC compression block size, and update its default value from 64KB to 256KB to keep consistent with spark or hive. [#80602](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80602) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Support writing parquet enum as byte array as the [spec](https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#enum) dictates. I'll write more info later. [#81090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81090) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Support writing geoparquets as output format. [#81784](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81784) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).

### Distributed queries and parallel replicas {#distributed-queries-and-parallel-replicas}

* A new setting, enable_add_distinct_to_in_subqueries, has been introduced. When enabled, ClickHouse will automatically add DISTINCT to subqueries in IN clauses for distributed queries. This can significantly reduce the size of temporary tables transferred between shards and improve network efficiency. Note: This is a trade-off—while network transfer is reduced, additional merging (deduplication) work is required on each node. Enable this setting when network transfer is a bottleneck and the merging cost is acceptable. [#81908](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81908) ([fhw12345](https://github.com/fhw12345)).
* Add support of `remote-()` table functions with parallel replicas if cluster is provided in `address_expression` argument. Also, fixes [#73295](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73295). [#82904](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82904) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Joins with parallel replicas now use the join logical step. In case of any issues with join queries using parallel replicas, try `SET query_plan_use_new_logical_join_step=0` and report an issue. [#83801](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83801) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).

### Settings and configuration {#settings-and-configuration}

* Mark setting `allow_experimental_join_condition` as obsolete. [#80566](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80566) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* The total and per-user network throttlers are never reset, which ensures that `max_network_bandwidth_for_all_users` and `max_network_bandwidth_for_all_users` limits are never exceeded. [#81729](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81729) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Introduce the `optimize_rewrite_regexp_functions` setting (enabled by default), which allows the optimizer to rewrite certain `replaceRegexpAll`, `replaceRegexpOne`, and `extract` calls into simpler and more efficient forms when specific regular expression patterns are detected. (issue [#81981](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/81981)). [#81992](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81992) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Tune TCP servers queue (64 by default) based on listen_backlog (4096 by default). [#82045](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82045) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add ability to reload `max_local_read_bandwidth_for_server` and `max_local_write_bandwidth_for_server` on fly without restart server. [#82083](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82083) ([Kai Zhu](https://github.com/nauu)).
* Introduce setting `enable_vector_similarity_index` which must be enabled to use the vector similarity index. The existing setting `allow_experimental_vector_similarity_index` is now obsolete. It still works in case someone needs it. [#83459](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83459) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Add [`max_joined_block_size_bytes`](/operations/settings/settings#max_joined_block_size_bytes) in addition to `max_joined_block_size_rows` to limit the memory usage of JOINs with heavy columns. [#83869](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83869) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Fix compatibility for cluster_function_process_archive_on_multiple_nodes. [#83968](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83968) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Enable correlated subqueries support by default. [#85107](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85107) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Add `database_replicated` settings defining the default values of DatabaseReplicatedSettings. If the setting is not present in the Replicated DB create query, the value from this setting is used. [#85127](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85127) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* Allow key value arguments in `s3` or `s3Cluster` table engine/function, e.g. for example `s3('url', CSV, structure = 'a Int32', compression_method = 'gzip')`. [#85134](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85134) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Execute non-correlated `EXISTS` as a scalar subquery. This allows using a scalar subquery cache and constant-folding the result, which is helpful for indexes. For compatibility, the new setting `execute_exists_as_scalar_subquery=1` is added. [#85481](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85481) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Support resolution of more cases for compound identifiers. Particularly, it improves the compatibility of `ARRAY JOIN` with the old analyzer. Introduce a new setting `analyzer_compatibility_allow_compound_identifiers_in_unflatten_nested` to keep the old behaviour. [#85492](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85492) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

### System tables and observability {#system-tables-and-observability}

* Add pressure metrics to ClickHouse async metrics. [#80779](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80779) ([Xander Garbett](https://github.com/Garbett1)).
* Add metrics `MarkCacheEvictedBytes`, `MarkCacheEvictedMarks`, `MarkCacheEvictedFiles` for tracking evictions from the mark cache. (issue [#60989](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/60989)). [#80799](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/80799) ([Shivji Kumar Jha](https://github.com/shiv4289)).
* The `system.formats` table now contains extended information about formats, such as HTTP content type, the capabilities of schema inference, etc. [#81505](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81505) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add support for clearing all warnings from the `system.warnings` table using `TRUNCATE TABLE system.warnings`. [#82087](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82087) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* List the licenses of rust crates in `system.licenses`. [#82440](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82440) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Estimate complex cnf/dnf, for example, `(a < 1 and a > 0) or b = 3`, by statistics. [#82663](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82663) ([Han Fei](https://github.com/hanfei1991)).
* In some cases, we need to have multiple dimensions to our metrics. For example, counting failed merges or mutations by error codes rather than having a single counter. [#83030](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83030) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Add process resource metrics (such as `UserTimeMicroseconds`, `SystemTimeMicroseconds`, `RealTimeMicroseconds`) to part_log profile events for `MergeParts` entries. [#83460](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83460) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Cgroup-level and system-wide metrics are reported now altogether. Cgroup-level metrics have names `CGroup<Metric>` and OS-level metrics (collected from procfs) have names `OS<Metric>`. [#84317](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84317) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Add dimensional metrics to monitor the size of concurrent bounded queues, labeled by queue type and instance ID for better observability. [#84675](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84675) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* The [`system.columns`](/operations/system-tables/columns) table now provides `column` as an alias for the existing `name` column. [#84695](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84695) ([Yunchi Pang](https://github.com/yunchipang)).
* Add format string column to `system.errors`. This column is needed to group by the same error type in alerting rules. [#84776](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84776) ([Miсhael Stetsyuk](https://github.com/mstetsyuk)).
* Make limits tunable for Async Log and add introspection. [#85105](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85105) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Ignore `UNKNOWN_DATABASE` while obtaining table columns sizes for system.columns. [#85632](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85632) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

### Database engines {#database-engines}

### System and internal improvements {#system-and-internal-improvements}

* Fix attaching databases with read-only remote disks by manually adding table UUIDs to the DatabaseCatalog. [#82670](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82670) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).
* Improve DDL task handling when `distributed_ddl_output_mode='*_only_active'` by not waiting for new or recovered replicas that have replication lag exceeding `max_replication_lag_to_enqueue`. This helps avoid `DDL task is not finished on some hosts` errors when a new replica becomes active after initialization or recovery but has accumulated a large replication log. Also implemented `SYSTEM SYNC DATABASE REPLICA STRICT` query that waits for the replication log to fall below `max_replication_lag_to_enqueue`. [#83302](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83302) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Chang SystemLogs shutdown order to occur after ordinary tables (and before system tables, instead of before ordinary tables). [#83134](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83134) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add server setting `logs_to_keep` for replicated database settings, allowing configuration of the default `logs_to_keep` parameter for replicated databases. Lower values reduce the number of ZooKeeper nodes (especially beneficial when there are many databases), while higher values allow missing replicas to catch up after longer periods of downtime. [#84183](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84183) ([Alexey Khatskevich](https://github.com/Khatskevich)).
* Change the default value of the Replicated database setting `max_retries_before_automatic_recovery` to 10, enabling faster recovery in some cases. [#84369](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84369) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Optimize non-append Refreshable Materialized View DDL operations in Replicated databases by skipping creation and renaming of old temporary tables. [#84858](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84858) ([Tuan Pham Anh](https://github.com/tuanpach)).

### Replication and synchronization {#replication-and-synchronization}

### SystemAndInternalImprovements {#systemandinternalimprovements}

* Improve `SYSTEM RESTART REPLICA` to retry table creation when ZooKeeper connection issues occur, preventing tables from being forgotten. [#82616](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82616) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Add UUID validation in `ReplicatedMergeTree::executeMetadataAlter` to prevent incorrect table definitions when tables are exchanged between getting the StorageID and calling `IDatabase::alterTable`. [#82666](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82666) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Remove experimental `send_metadata` logic related to experimental zero-copy replication. This code was never used, unsupported, and likely broken, with no tests to verify its functionality. [#82508](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82508) ([alesapin](https://github.com/alesapin)).
* Add support for macro expansion in `remote_fs_zero_copy_zookeeper_path`. [#85437](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85437) ([Mikhail Koviazin](https://github.com/mkmkme)).

### Functions and expressions {#functions-and-expressions}

* Function `addressToSymbol` and `system.symbols` table will use file offsets instead of virtual memory addresses. [#81896](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81896) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Try to preserve element names when deriving supertypes for named tuples. [#81345](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81345) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Allow to mix different collations for the same column in different windows. [#82877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82877) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Add function to write types into wkb format. [#82935](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82935) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Add ability to parse `Time` and `Time64` as MM:SS, M:SS, SS, or S. [#83299](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83299) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* Function `reinterpret()` now supports conversion to `Array(T)` where `T` is a fixed-size data type (issue [#82621](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82621)). [#83399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83399) ([Shankar Iyer](https://github.com/shankar-iyer)).
* Fix `structureToProtobufSchema` and `structureToCapnProtoSchema` functions to correctly add a zero-terminating byte instead of using a newline, preventing missing newlines in output and potential buffer overflows in functions that depend on the zero byte (such as `logTrace`, `demangle`, `extractURLParameter`, `toStringCutToZero`, and `encrypt`/`decrypt`). Closes [#85062](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/85062). [#85063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85063) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix the `regexp_tree` dictionary layout to support processing strings with zero bytes. [#85063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85063) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix the `formatRowNoNewline` function which was erroneously cutting the last character of output when called with `Values` format or any format without a newline at the end of rows. [#85063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85063) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix an exception-safety error in the `stem` function that could lead to memory leaks in rare scenarios. [#85063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85063) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix the `initcap` function for `FixedString` arguments to correctly recognize the start of words at the beginning of strings when the previous string in a block ended with a word character. [#85063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85063) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix a security vulnerability in the Apache `ORC` format that could lead to exposure of uninitialized memory. [#85063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85063) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Changed behavior of `replaceRegexpAll` and its alias `REGEXP_REPLACE` to allow empty matches at the end of strings even when the previous match processed the entire string (e.g., `^a*|a*$` or `^|.*`), aligning with JavaScript, Perl, Python, PHP, and Ruby semantics but differing from PostgreSQL. [#85063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85063) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Optimize and simplify the implementation of many string-handling functions. Corrected incorrect documentation for several functions. Note: The output of `byteSize` for String columns and complex types containing String columns has changed from 9 bytes per empty string to 8 bytes per empty string, which is the expected behavior. [#85063](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85063) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow zero step in functions `timeSeries*ToGrid()` This is part `#3` of https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75036. [#85390](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85390) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support inner arrays for the function `nested`. [#85719](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85719) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).

### MergeTree improvements {#mergetree-improvements}

* Disable skipping indexes that depend on columns updated on the fly or by patch parts more granularly. Now, skipping indexes are not used only in parts affected by on-the-fly mutations or patch parts; previously, those indexes were disabled for all parts. [#84241](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84241) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Add MergeTree setting `search_orphaned_parts_drives` to limit scope to look for parts e.g. by disks with local metadata. [#84710](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84710) ([Ilya Golshtein](https://github.com/ilejn)).
* Add missing support of `read_in_order_use_virtual_row` for `WHERE`. It allows to skip reading more parts for queries with filters that were not fully pushed to `PREWHERE`. [#84835](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84835) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Fix usage of "compact" Variant discriminators serialization in MergeTree. Perviously it wasn't used in some cases when it could be used. [#84141](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84141) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Add limit (table setting [`max_uncompressed_bytes_in_patches`](/operations/settings/merge-tree-settings#max_uncompressed_bytes_in_patches)) for total uncompressed bytes in patch parts. It prevents significant slowdowns of `SELECT` queries after lightweight updates and prevents possible misuse of lightweight updates. [#85641](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85641) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).

### Cache and memory management {#cache-and-memory-management}

* Fix logical error in filesystem cache: "Having zero bytes but range is not finished". [#81868](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81868) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Add rendezvous hashing to improve cache locality. [#82511](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82511) ([Anton Ivashkin](https://github.com/ianton-ru)).
* Refactor dynamic resize feature of filesystem cache. Added more logs for introspection. [#82556](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82556) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Reduce query memory tracking overhead for executable user-defined functions. [#83929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83929) ([Eduard Karacharov](https://github.com/korowa)).
* All the allocations done by external libraries are now visible to ClickHouse's memory tracker and accounted properly. This may result in "increased" reported memory usage for certain queries or failures with `MEMORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`. [#84082](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84082) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Allocate the minimum amount of memory needed for encrypted_buffer for encrypted named collections. [#84432](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/84432) ([Pablo Marcos](https://github.com/pamarcos)).

### Vector similarity index {#vector-similarity-index}

* Prevent user from using `nan` and `inf` with `NumericIndexedVector`. Fixes [#82239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82239) and a little more. [#82681](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82681) ([Raufs Dunamalijevs](https://github.com/rienath)).
* The vector similarity index now supports binary quantization. Binary quantization significantly reduces the memory consumption and speeds up the process of building a vector index (due to faster distance calculation). Also, the existing setting `vector_search_postfilter_multiplier `was made obsolete and replaced by a more general setting : `vector_search_index_fetch_multiplier`. [#85024](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85024) ([Shankar Iyer](https://github.com/shankar-iyer)).
* Approximate vector search with vector similarity indexes is now GA. [#85888](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85888) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

### Error handling and messages {#error-handling-and-messages}

* Header Connection is sent at the end of headers. When we know is the connection should be preserved. [#81951](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/81951) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* In previous versions, multiplication of the aggregate function state with IPv4 produced a logical error instead of a proper error code. Closes [#82817](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82817). [#82818](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/82818) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Better error handling in `AsynchronousMetrics`. If the `/sys/block` directory exists but is not accessible, the server will start without monitoring the block devices. Closes [#79229](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/79229). [#83115](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83115) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* There was an incorrect dependency check for the `INSERT` with materialized views that have malformed selects and the user might have received an obscure `std::exception` instead of a meaningful error with a clear explanation. This is now fixed. This fixes: [#82889](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/82889). [#83190](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83190) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).

### TTL and MergeTree fixes {#ttl-and-mergetree-fixes}

* Recalculate the min-max index when TTL reduces rows to ensure the correctness of algorithms relying on it, such as `minmax_count_projection`. This resolves [#77091](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/77091). [#77166](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/77166) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).

* Fix a bug introduced in [#79963](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/79963). When inserting into a materialized view with a definer, the permission check should use the definer's grants. Fixes [#79951](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/79951). [#83502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83502) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).

* Skip unavailable nodes during INSERT SELECT from s3Cluster() into replicated MergeTree. [#83676](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/83676) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Fix early return condition for S3 request rate slowdown: require either s3_slow_all_threads_after_network_error or backup_slow_all_threads_after_retryable_s3_error to be true to enable slowdown behavior when all threads are paused due to a retryable error, instead of requiring both. [#85505](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/85505) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).

### MongoDB fixes {#mongodb-fixes}

* Previously, `MongoDB` table engine definitions could include a path component in the `host:port` argument which was silently ignored. The mongodb integration refuses to load such tables. With this fix *we allow loading such tables and ignore path component* if `MongoDB` engine has five arguments, using the database name from arguments. *Note:* The fix is not applied for newly created tables or queries with `mongo` table function, as well as for dictionary sources and named collections.
