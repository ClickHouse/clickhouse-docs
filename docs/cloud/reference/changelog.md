  in ClickHouse Cloud. With just a few clicks, you can now replicate your Postgres
  databases and unlock blazing-fast, real-time analytics. The connector delivers 
  faster data synchronization, latency as low as a few seconds, automatic schema changes,
  fully secure connectivity, and more. Refer to the 
  [blog](https://clickhouse.com/blog/postgres-cdc-connector-clickpipes-ga) for 
  more information. To get started, refer to the instructions [here](https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/clickpipes/postgres).

- Introduced new improvements to the SQL console dashboards:
  - Sharing: You can share your dashboard with your team members. Four levels of access are supported, that can be adjusted both globally and on a per-user basis:
    - _Write access_: Add/edit visualizations, refresh settings, interact with dashboards via filters.
    - _Owner_: Share a dashboard, delete a dashboard, and all other permissions of a user with "write access".
    - _Read-only access_: View and interact with dashboard via filters
    - _No access_: Cannot view a dashboard
  - For existing dashboards that have already been created, Organization Administrators can assign existing dashboards to themselves as owners.
  - You can now add a table or chart from the SQL console to a dashboard from the query view.

<Image img={dashboards} size="md" alt="Dashboards improvements" border />


- We are enlisting preview participants for [Distributed cache](https://clickhouse.com/cloud/distributed-cache-waitlist) 
  for AWS and GCP. Read more in the [blog](https://clickhouse.com/blog/building-a-distributed-cache-for-s3).

## May 16, 2025 {#may-16-2025}

- Introduced the Resource Utilization Dashboard which provides a view of 
  resources being used by a service in ClickHouse Cloud. The following metrics 
  are scraped from system tables, and displayed on this dashboard:
  * Memory & CPU: Graphs for `CGroupMemoryTotal` (Allocated Memory), `CGroupMaxCPU` (allocated CPU),
    `MemoryResident` (memory used), and `ProfileEvent_OSCPUVirtualTimeMicroseconds` (CPU used)
  * Data Transfer: Graphs showing data ingress and egress from ClickHouse Cloud. Learn more [here](/cloud/manage/network-data-transfer).
- We’re excited to announce the launch of our new ClickHouse Cloud Prometheus/Grafana mix-in, 
  built to simplify monitoring for your ClickHouse Cloud services.
  This mix-in uses our Prometheus-compatible API endpoint to seamlessly integrate
  ClickHouse metrics into your existing Prometheus and Grafana setup. It includes
  a pre-configured dashboard that gives you real-time visibility into the health 
  and performance of your services. Refer to the launch [blog](https://clickhouse.com/blog/monitor-with-new-prometheus-grafana-mix-in) to read more.

## April 18, 2025 {#april-18-2025}

- Introduced a new **Member** organization level role and two new service level 
  roles: **Service Admin** and **Service Read Only**.
  **Member** is an organization level role that is assigned to SAML SSO users by 
  default and provides only sign-in and profile update capabilities. **Service Admin** 
  and **Service Read Only** roles for one or more services can be assigned to users 
  with **Member**, **Developer**, or **Billing Admin** roles. For more information 
  see ["Access control in ClickHouse Cloud"](https://clickhouse.com/docs/cloud/security/cloud-access-management/overview)

  automatic alerts for ClickPipes failures via email, ClickHouse Cloud UI, and 
  Slack. Notifications via email and UI are enabled by default and can be 
  configured per pipe. For **Postgres CDC ClickPipes**, alerts also cover 
  replication slot threshold (configurable in the **Settings** tab), specific error
  types, and self-serve steps to resolve failures.
- **MySQL CDC private preview** is now open. This lets customers replicate MySQL 
  databases to ClickHouse Cloud in a few clicks, enabling fast analytics and 
  removing the need for external ETL tools. The connector supports both continuous
  replication and one-time migrations, whether MySQL is on the cloud (RDS, 
  Aurora, Cloud SQL, Azure, etc.) or on-premises. You can sign up to the private
  preview by [following this link](https://clickhouse.com/cloud/clickpipes/mysql-cdc-connector).
- Introduced **AWS PrivateLink for ClickPipes**. You can use AWS PrivateLink to 
  establish secure connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, your on-premises 
  systems, and ClickHouse Cloud. This can be done without exposing traffic to 
  the public internet while moving data from sources like Postgres, MySQL, and 
  MSK on AWS. It also supports cross-region access through VPC service endpoints.
  PrivateLink connectivity set-up is now [fully self-serve](https://clickhouse.com/docs/integrations/clickpipes/aws-privatelink)
  through ClickPipes.

## April 4, 2025 {#april-4-2025}

## January 27, 2025 {#january-27-2025}

### Changes to ClickHouse Cloud tiers {#changes-to-clickhouse-cloud-tiers}

We are dedicated to adapting our products to meet the ever-changing requirements of our customers. Since its introduction in GA over the past two years, ClickHouse Cloud has evolved substantially, and we've gained invaluable insights into how our customers leverage our cloud offerings.

We are introducing new features to optimize the sizing and cost-efficiency of ClickHouse Cloud services for your workloads. These include **compute-compute separation**, high-performance machine types, and **single-replica services**. We are also evolving automatic scaling and managed upgrades to execute in a more seamless and reactive fashion.

We are adding a **new Enterprise tier** to serve the needs of the most demanding customers and workloads, with focus on industry-specific security and compliance features, even more controls over underlying hardware and upgrades, and advanced disaster recovery features.

To support these changes, we are restructuring our current **Development** and **Production** tiers to more closely match how our evolving customer base is using our offerings. We are introducing the **Basic** tier, oriented toward users that are testing out new ideas and projects, and the **Scale** tier, matching users working with production workloads and data at scale.

You can read about these and other functional changes in this [blog](https://clickhouse.com/blog/evolution-of-clickhouse-cloud-new-features-superior-performance-tailored-offerings). Existing customers will need to take action to select a [new plan](https://clickhouse.com/pricing). Customer-facing communication was sent via email to organization administrators, and the following [FAQ](/cloud/manage/jan-2025-faq/summary) covers the key changes and timelines.

### Warehouses: Compute-compute separation (GA) {#warehouses-compute-compute-separation-ga}

Compute-compute separation (also known as "Warehouses") is Generally Available; please refer to [blog](https://clickhouse.com/blog/introducing-warehouses-compute-compute-separation-in-clickhouse-cloud) for more details and the [documentation](/cloud/reference/warehouses).

### Single-replica services {#single-replica-services}

We are introducing the concept of a "single-replica service", both as a standalone offering and within warehouses. As a standalone offering, single-replica services are size limited and intended to be used for small test workloads. Within warehouses, single-replica services can be deployed at larger sizes, and utilized for workloads not requiring high availability at scale, such as restartable ETL jobs.

### Vertical auto-scaling improvements {#vertical-auto-scaling-improvements}

We are introducing a new vertical scaling mechanism for compute replicas, which we call "Make Before Break" (MBB). This approach adds one or more replicas of the new size before removing the old replicas, preventing any loss of capacity during scaling operations. By eliminating the gap between removing existing replicas and adding new ones, MBB creates a more seamless and less disruptive scaling process. It is especially beneficial in scale-up scenarios, where high resource utilization triggers the need for additional capacity, since removing replicas prematurely would only exacerbate the resource constraints.

### Horizontal scaling (GA) {#horizontal-scaling-ga}

Horizontal scaling is now Generally Available. Users can add additional replicas to scale out their service through the APIs and the cloud console. Please refer to the [documentation](/manage/scaling#manual-horizontal-scaling) for information.

### Configurable backups {#configurable-backups}

We now support the ability for customers to export backups to their own cloud account; please refer to the [documentation](/cloud/manage/backups/configurable-backups) for additional information.

### Managed upgrade improvements {#managed-upgrade-improvements}

Safe managed upgrades deliver significant value to our users by allowing them to stay current with the database as it moves forward to add features. With this rollout, we applied the "make before break" (or MBB) approach to upgrades, further reducing impact to running workloads.

### HIPAA support {#hipaa-support}

We now support HIPAA in compliant regions, including AWS `us-east-1`, `us-west-2` and GCP `us-central1`, `us-east1`. Customers wishing to onboard must sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) and deploy to the compliant version of the region. For more information on HIPAA, please refer to the [documentation](/cloud/security/security-and-compliance).

### Scheduled upgrades {#scheduled-upgrades}

Users can schedule upgrades for their services. This feature is supported for Enterprise tier services only. For more information on Scheduled upgrades, please refer to the [documentation](/manage/updates).

### Language client support for complex types {#language-client-support-for-complex-types}

[Golang](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-go/releases/tag/v2.30.1), [Python](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-connect/releases/tag/v0.8.11), and [NodeJS](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-js/releases/tag/1.10.1) clients added support for Dynamic, Variant, and JSON types.

### DBT support for Refreshable Materialized Views {#dbt-support-for-refreshable-materialized-views}

DBT now [supports Refreshable Materialized Views](https://github.com/ClickHouse/dbt-clickhouse/releases/tag/v1.8.7) in the `1.8.7` release.

### JWT token support {#jwt-token-support}

Support has been added for JWT-based authentication in the JDBC driver v2, clickhouse-java, [Python](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-connect/releases/tag/v0.8.12), and[ NodeJS](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-js/releases/tag/1.10.0) clients.

JDBC / Java will be in[ 0.8.0](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/releases/tag/v0.8.0) when it's released - ETA pending.

### Prometheus integration improvements {#prometheus-integration-improvements}

We've added several enhancements for the Prometheus integration:

- **Organization-level endpoint**. We've introduced an enhancement to our Prometheus integration for ClickHouse Cloud. In addition to service-level metrics, the API now includes an endpoint for **organization-level metrics**. This new endpoint automatically collects metrics for all services within your organization, streamlining the process of exporting metrics into your Prometheus collector. These metrics can be integrated with visualization tools like Grafana and Datadog for a more comprehensive view of your organization's performance.

  This feature is available now for all users. You can find more details [here](/integrations/prometheus).

- **Filtered metrics**. We've added support for returning a filtered list of metrics in our Prometheus integration for ClickHouse Cloud. This feature helps reduce response payload size by enabling you to focus on metrics that are critical for monitoring the health of your service.

  This functionality is available via an optional query parameter in the API, making it easier to optimize your data collection and streamline integrations with tools like Grafana and Datadog.

  The filtered metrics feature is now available for all users. You can find more details [here](/integrations/prometheus).


## December 20, 2024 {#december-20-2024}

### Marketplace subscription organization attachment {#marketplace-subscription-organization-attachment}

You can now attach your new marketplace subscription to an existing ClickHouse Cloud organization. Once you finish subscribing to the marketplace and redirect to ClickHouse Cloud, you can connect an existing organization created in the past to the new marketplace subscription. From this point, your resources in the organization will be billed via the marketplace. 

<Image img={add_marketplace} size="md" alt="ClickHouse Cloud interface showing how to add a marketplace subscription to an existing organization" border />

### Force OpenAPI key expiration {#force-openapi-key-expiration}

It is now possible to restrict the expiry options of API keys so you don't create unexpired OpenAPI keys. Please contact the ClickHouse Cloud Support team to enable these restrictions for your organization.

### Custom emails for notifications {#custom-emails-for-notifications}

Org Admins can now add more email addresses to a specific notification as additional recipients. This is useful in case you want to send notifications to an alias or to other users within your organization who might not be users of ClickHouse Cloud. To configure this, go to the Notification Settings from the cloud console and edit the email addresses that you want to receive the email notifications. 

## December 6, 2024 {#december-6-2024}

### Compute-compute separation is now in Private Preview for AWS {#compute-compute-separation-is-now-in-private-preview-for-aws}

For existing ClickHouse Cloud services, replicas handle both reads and writes, and there is no way to configure a certain replica to handle only one kind of operation. We have an upcoming new feature called Compute-compute separation that allows you to designate specific services as read-write or read-only services, allowing you to design the optimal compute configuration for your application to optimize cost and performance.

Our new compute-compute separation feature enables you to create multiple compute node groups, each with its own endpoint, that are using the same object storage folder, and thus, with the same tables, views, etc. Read more about [Compute-compute separation here](/cloud/reference/warehouses). Please [contact support](https://clickhouse.com/support/program) if you would like access to this feature in Private Preview.

<Image img={cloud_console_2} size="lg" alt="Diagram showing example architecture for compute-compute separation with read-write and read-only service groups" border />

### ClickPipes for S3 and GCS now in GA, Continuous mode support {#clickpipes-for-s3-and-gcs-now-in-ga-continuous-mode-support}

ClickPipes is the easiest way to ingest data into ClickHouse Cloud. We're happy to announce that [ClickPipes](https://clickhouse.com/cloud/clickpipes) for S3 and GCS is now **Generally Available**. ClickPipes supports both one-time batch ingest and "continuous mode". An ingest task will load all the files matched by a pattern from a specific remote bucket into the ClickHouse destination table. In "continuous mode", the ClickPipes job will run constantly, ingesting matching files that get added into the remote object storage bucket as they arrive. This will allow users to turn any object storage bucket into a fully fledged staging area for ingesting data into ClickHouse Cloud. Read more about ClickPipes in [our documentation](/integrations/clickpipes).

## July 18, 2024 {#july-18-2024}

### Prometheus Endpoint for Metrics is now Generally Available {#prometheus-endpoint-for-metrics-is-now-generally-available}

In our last cloud changelog, we announced the Private Preview for exporting [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics from ClickHouse Cloud. This feature allows you to use the [ClickHouse Cloud API](/cloud/manage/api/api-overview) to get your metrics into tools like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) for visualization. We're happy to announce that this feature is now **Generally Available**. Please see [our docs](/integrations/prometheus) to learn more about this feature.

### Table Inspector in Cloud Console {#table-inspector-in-cloud-console}

ClickHouse has commands like [`DESCRIBE`](/sql-reference/statements/describe-table) that allow you to introspect your table to examine schema. These commands output to the console, but they are often not convenient to use as you need to combine several queries to retrieve all pertinent data about your tables and columns.

We recently launched a **Table Inspector** in the cloud console which allows you to retrieve important table and column information in the UI, without having to write SQL. You can try out the Table Inspector for your services by checking out the cloud console. It provides information about your schema, storage, compression, and more in one unified interface.

<Image img={compute_compute} size="lg" alt="ClickHouse Cloud Table Inspector interface showing detailed schema and storage information" border />

### New Java Client API {#new-java-client-api}

Our [Java Client](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java) is one of the most popular clients that users use to connect to ClickHouse. We wanted to make it even easier and more intuitive to use, including a re-designed API and various performance optimizations. These changes will make it much easier to connect to ClickHouse from your Java applications. You can read more about how to use the updated Java Client in this [blog post](https://clickhouse.com/blog/java-client-sequel).

### New Analyzer is enabled by default {#new-analyzer-is-enabled-by-default}

For the last couple of years, we've been working on a new analyzer for query analysis and optimization. This analyzer improves query performance and will allow us to make further optimizations, including faster and more efficient `JOIN`s. Previously, it was required that new users enable this feature using the setting `allow_experimental_analyzer`. This improved analyzer is now available on new ClickHouse Cloud services by default.

Stay tuned for more improvements to the analyzer as we have many more optimizations planned!

## June 28, 2024 {#june-28-2024}

### ClickHouse Cloud for Microsoft Azure is now Generally Available! {#clickhouse-cloud-for-microsoft-azure-is-now-generally-available}

We first announced Microsoft Azure support in Beta [this past May](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-cloud-is-now-on-azure-in-public-beta). In this latest cloud release, we're happy to announce that our Azure support is transitioning from Beta to Generally Available. ClickHouse Cloud is now available on all the three major cloud platforms: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and now Microsoft Azure.

This release also includes support for subscriptions via the [Microsoft Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/clickhouse.clickhouse_cloud). The service will initially be supported in the following regions:
- United States: West US 3 (Arizona)
- United States: East US 2 (Virginia)
- Europe: Germany West Central (Frankfurt)

If you'd like any specific region to be supported, please [contact us](https://clickhouse.com/support/program).

### Query Log Insights {#query-log-insights}

Our new Query Insights UI in the Cloud Console makes ClickHouse's built-in query log a lot easier to use. ClickHouse's `system.query_log` table is a key source of information for query optimization, debugging, and monitoring overall cluster health and performance.  There's just one caveat: with 70+ fields and multiple records per query, interpreting the query log represents a steep learning curve. This initial version of query insights provides a blueprint for future work to simplify query debugging and optimization patterns. We'd love to hear your feedback as we continue to iterate on this feature, so please reach out—your input will be greatly appreciated!

<Image img={query_insights} size="lg" alt="ClickHouse Cloud Query Insights UI showing query performance metrics and analysis" border />

### Prometheus Endpoint for Metrics (Private Preview) {#prometheus-endpoint-for-metrics-private-preview}

Perhaps one of our most requested features: you can now export [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics from ClickHouse Cloud to [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) for visualization. Prometheus provides an open-source solution to monitor ClickHouse and set up custom alerts. Access to Prometheus metrics for your ClickHouse Cloud service is available via the [ClickHouse Cloud API](/integrations/prometheus). This feature is currently in Private Preview. Please reach out to the [support team](https://clickhouse.com/support/program) to enable this feature for your organization.

<Image img={prometheus} size="lg" alt="Grafana dashboard showing Prometheus metrics from ClickHouse Cloud" border />

### Other features: {#other-features}
- [Configurable backups](/cloud/manage/backups/configurable-backups) to configure custom backup policies like frequency, retention, and schedule are now Generally Available.

## June 13, 2024 {#june-13-2024}

### Configurable offsets for Kafka ClickPipes Connector (Beta) {#configurable-offsets-for-kafka-clickpipes-connector-beta}

Until recently, whenever you set up a new [Kafka Connector for ClickPipes](/integrations/clickpipes/kafka), it always consumed data from the beginning of the Kafka topic. In this situation, it may not be flexible enough to fit specific use cases when you need to reprocess historical data, monitor new incoming data, or resume from a precise point.

ClickPipes for Kafka has added a new feature that enhances the flexibility and control over data consumption from Kafka topics. You can now configure the offset from which data is consumed.

The following options are available:
- From the beginning: Start consuming data from the very beginning of the Kafka topic. This option is ideal for users who need to reprocess all historical data.
- From latest: Begin consuming data from the most recent offset. This is useful for users who are only interested in new messages.
- From a timestamp: Start consuming data from messages that were produced at or after a specific timestamp. This feature allows for more precise control, enabling users to resume processing from an exact point in time.

<Image img={kafka_config} size="lg" alt="ClickPipes Kafka connector configuration interface showing offset selection options" border />

### Enroll services to the Fast release channel {#enroll-services-to-the-fast-release-channel}

The Fast release channel allows your services to receive updates ahead of the release schedule. Previously, this feature required assistance from the support team to enable. Now, you can use the ClickHouse Cloud console to enable this feature for your services directly. Simply navigate to **Settings**, and click **Enroll in fast releases**. Your service will now receive updates as soon as they are available!

<Image img={fast_releases} size="lg" alt="ClickHouse Cloud settings page showing the option to enroll in fast releases" border />

### Terraform support for horizontal scaling {#terraform-support-for-horizontal-scaling}

ClickHouse Cloud supports [horizontal scaling](/manage/scaling#how-scaling-works-in-clickhouse-cloud), or the ability to add additional replicas of the same size to your services. Horizontal scaling improves performance and parallelization to support concurrent queries. Previously, adding more replicas required either using the ClickHouse Cloud console or the API. You can now use Terraform to add or remove replicas from your service, allowing you to programmatically scale your ClickHouse services as needed.

Please see the [ClickHouse Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ClickHouse/clickhouse/latest/docs) for more information.

## May 30, 2024 {#may-30-2024}

### Share queries with your teammates {#share-queries-with-your-teammates}

When you write a SQL query, there's a good chance that other people on your team would also find that query useful. Previously, you'd have to send a query over Slack or email and there would be no way for a teammate to automatically receive updates for that query if you edit it.

We're happy to announce that you can now easily share queries via the ClickHouse Cloud console. From the query editor, you can share a query directly with your entire team or a specific team member. You can also specify whether they have read or write only access. Click on the **Share** button in the query editor to try out the new shared queries feature.

<Image img={share_queries} size="lg" alt="ClickHouse Cloud query editor showing the share functionality with permission options" border />

### ClickHouse Cloud for Microsoft Azure is now in beta {#clickhouse-cloud-for-microsoft-azure-is-now-in-beta}

We've finally launched the ability to create ClickHouse Cloud services on Microsoft Azure! We already have many customers using ClickHouse Cloud on Azure in production as part of our Private Preview program. Now, anyone can create their own service on Azure. All of your favorite ClickHouse features that are supported on AWS and GCP will also work on Azure.

We expect to have ClickHouse Cloud for Azure ready for General Availability in the next few weeks. [Read this blog post](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-cloud-is-now-on-azure-in-public-beta) to learn more, or create your new service using Azure via the ClickHouse Cloud console.

Note: **Development** services for Azure are not supported at this time.

### Set up Private Link via the Cloud Console {#set-up-private-link-via-the-cloud-console}

Our Private Link feature allows you to connect your ClickHouse Cloud services with internal services in your cloud provider account without having to direct traffic to the public internet, saving costs and enhancing security. Previously, this was difficult to set up and required using the ClickHouse Cloud API.

You can now configure private endpoints in just a few clicks directly from the ClickHouse Cloud console. Simply go to your service's **Settings**, go to the **Security** section and click **Set up private endpoint**.

<Image img={private_endpoint} size="lg" alt="ClickHouse Cloud console showing private endpoint setup interface in the security settings" border />

As this feature is in private preview, please contact support@clickhouse.com to enable this for your service. Read more about configurable backups [here](https://clickhouse.com/blog/configurable-backups-in-clickhouse-cloud).

### Create APIs from your SQL queries (Beta) {#create-apis-from-your-sql-queries-beta}

When you write a SQL query for ClickHouse, you still need to connect to ClickHouse via a driver to expose your query to your application. Now with our now **Query Endpoints** feature, you can execute SQL queries directly from an API without any configuration. You can specify the query endpoints to return JSON, CSV, or TSVs. Click the "Share" button in the cloud console to try this new feature with your queries. Read more about Query Endpoints [here](https://clickhouse.com/blog/automatic-query-endpoints).

- User-facing backward incompatible change: Previously, two features ([is_deleted](/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replacingmergetree#is_deleted) and ``OPTIMIZE CLEANUP``) under certain conditions could lead to corruption of the data in ClickHouse. To protect the integrity of the data of our users, while keeping the core of the functionality, we adjusted how this feature works. Specifically, the MergeTree setting ``clean_deleted_rows`` is now deprecated and has no effect anymore. The ``CLEANUP`` keyword is not allowed by default (to use it you will need to enable ``allow_experimental_replacing_merge_with_cleanup``). If you decide to use ``CLEANUP``, you need to make sure that it is always used together with ``FINAL``, and you must guarantee that no rows with older versions will be inserted after you run ``OPTIMIZE FINAL CLEANUP``.

## November 3, 2022 {#november-3-2022}

This release removes read & write units from pricing (see the [pricing page](https://clickhouse.com/pricing) for details), updates the ClickHouse version to 22.10, adds support for higher vertical scaling for self-service customers, and improves reliability through better defaults.

### General changes {#general-changes-6}

- Removed read/write units from the pricing model

### Configuration changes {#configuration-changes-2}

- The settings `allow_suspicious_low_cardinality_types`, `allow_suspicious_fixed_string_types` and `allow_suspicious_codecs` (default is false) cannot be changed by users anymore for stability reasons.

### Console changes {#console-changes-31}

### ClickHouse 22.10 version upgrade {#clickhouse-2210-version-upgrade}

- Improved control over merging with the `min_age_to_force_merge_seconds` setting, to merge after a certain time threshold.
- Added MySQL-compatible syntax to reset settings `SET setting_name = DEFAULT`.

## October 25, 2022 {#october-25-2022}

This release significantly lowers compute consumption for small workloads, lowers compute pricing (see [pricing](https://clickhouse.com/pricing) page for details), improves stability through better defaults, and enhances the Billing and Usage views in the ClickHouse Cloud console.

### General changes {#general-changes-7}

- Reduced minimum service memory allocation to 24G
- Reduced service idle timeout from 30 minutes to 5 minutes

### Configuration changes {#configuration-changes-3}

- Reduced max_parts_in_total from 100k to 10k. The default value of the `max_parts_in_total` setting for MergeTree tables has been lowered from 100,000 to 10,000. The reason for this change is that we observed that a large number of data parts is likely to cause a slow startup time of services in the cloud. A large number of parts usually indicates a choice of too granular partition key, which is typically done accidentally and should be avoided. The change of default will allow the detection of these cases earlier.

### Console changes {#console-changes-32}

- Enhanced credit usage details in the Billing view for trial users
- Improved tooltips and help text, and added a link to the pricing page in the Usage view
- Improved workflow when switching options for IP filtering
- Added resend email confirmation button to the cloud console
