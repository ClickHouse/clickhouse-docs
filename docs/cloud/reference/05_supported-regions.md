## Private regions {#private-regions}

<EnterprisePlanFeatureBadge feature="Private regions feature"/>

We offer Private regions for our Enterprise tier services. Please [Contact us](https://clickhouse.com/company/contact) for private region requests.

Key considerations for private regions:
- Services will not auto-scale.
- Services cannot be stopped or idled.
- Manual scaling (both vertical and horizontal) can be enabled with a support ticket.
- If a service requires configuration with CMEK, the customer must provide the AWS KMS key during service launch.
- To launch services new and additional, requests will need to be made through a support ticket.
  
Additional requirements may apply for HIPAA compliance (including signing a BAA). Note that HIPAA is currently available only for Enterprise tier services
