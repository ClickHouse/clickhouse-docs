<br />

5. Note that at this point, the setup is not complete yet. You will need to redirect to ClickHouse Cloud by clicking on **Set up your account** and signing up on ClickHouse Cloud.

6. Once you redirect to ClickHouse Cloud, you can either login with an existing account, or register with a new account. This step is very important so we can bind your ClickHouse Cloud organization to the GCP Marketplace billing.

After verifying your email, you can leave the ClickHouse Cloud login page and login using the new username at the [https://console.clickhouse.cloud](https://console.clickhouse.cloud).

8. Once you login, you can confirm that your billing is in fact tied to the GCP Marketplace and start setting up your ClickHouse Cloud resources.
