## Data transfer pricing {#data-transfer-pricing}

### How are users charged for data transfer, and will this vary across organization tiers and regions? {#how-are-users-charged-for-data-transfer-and-will-this-vary-across-organization-tiers-and-regions}

- Users pay for data transfer along two dimensions â€” public internet egress and inter-region egress. There are no charges for intra-region data transfer or Private Link/Private Service Connect use and data transfer. However, we reserve the right to implement additional data transfer pricing dimensions if we see usage patterns that impact our ability to charge users appropriately.
- Data transfer pricing varies by Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and region.
- Data transfer pricing does **not** vary between organizational tiers.
- Public egress pricing is based only on the origin region. Inter-region (or cross-region) pricing depends on both the origin and destination regions.

### Will data transfer pricing be tiered as usage increases? {#will-data-transfer-pricing-be-tiered-as-usage-increases}

Data transfer prices will **not** be tiered as usage increases. Pricing varies by region and cloud service provider.
