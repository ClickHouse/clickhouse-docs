> This is **Part 2** of a guide on migrating from PostgreSQL to ClickHouse. Using a practical example, it demonstrates how to efficiently carry out the migration with a real-time replication (CDC) approach. Many of the concepts covered are also applicable to manual bulk data transfers from PostgreSQL to ClickHouse.

Most SQL queries from your PostgreSQL setup should run in ClickHouse without modification and will likely execute faster.

## Deduplication using CDC {#deduplication-cdc}

When using real-time replication with CDC, keep in mind that updates and deletes may result in duplicate rows. To manage this, you can use techniques involving Views and Refreshable Materialized Views. 

Refer to this [guide](/integrations/clickpipes/postgres/deduplication#query-like-with-postgres) to learn how to migrate your application from PostgreSQL to ClickHouse with minimal friction when migrating using real-time replication with CDC.

## Optimize queries in ClickHouse {#optimize-queries-in-clickhouse}

While this is possible to migrate with minimum query rewriting, it is recommended to leverage ClickHouse features to significantly simplify queries and further improve query performance.

The examples here covers common query patterns and show how to optimize them with ClickHouse. They use the full [Stack Overflow dataset](/getting-started/example-datasets/stackoverflow) (up to April 2024) on equivalent resources in PostgreSQL and ClickHouse (8 cores, 32GiB RAM).

> For simplicity, the queries below omit the use of techniques to deduplicate the data. 

> Counts here will slightly differ as the Postgres data only contains rows which satisfy the referential integrity of the foreign keys. ClickHouse imposes no such constraints and thus has the full dataset e.g. inc. anon users.

Users (with more than 10 questions) which receive the most views:

```sql
-- ClickHouse
SELECT OwnerDisplayName, sum(ViewCount) AS total_views
FROM stackoverflow.posts
WHERE (PostTypeId = 'Question') AND (OwnerDisplayName != '')
GROUP BY OwnerDisplayName
HAVING count() > 10
ORDER BY total_views DESC
LIMIT 5

Which `tags` receive the most `views`:

```sql
--ClickHouse
SELECT arrayJoin(arrayFilter(t -> (t != ''), splitByChar('|', Tags))) AS tags,
        sum(ViewCount) AS views
FROM posts
GROUP BY tags

**Aggregate functions**

Where possible, users should exploit ClickHouse aggregate functions. Below we show the use of the [argMax](/sql-reference/aggregate-functions/reference/argmax) function to compute the most viewed question of each year.

```sql
--ClickHouse
SELECT  toYear(CreationDate) AS Year,
        argMax(Title, ViewCount) AS MostViewedQuestionTitle,
        max(ViewCount) AS MaxViewCount
FROM stackoverflow.posts
WHERE PostTypeId = 'Question'
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY Year ASC
FORMAT Vertical
Row 1:
──────
Year:                   2008
MostViewedQuestionTitle: How to find the index for a given item in a list?
MaxViewCount:           6316987

Row 2:
──────
Year:                   2009
MostViewedQuestionTitle: How do I undo the most recent local commits in Git?
MaxViewCount:           13962748

...

Row 16:
───────
Year:                   2023
MostViewedQuestionTitle: How do I solve "error: externally-managed-environment" every time I use pip 3?
MaxViewCount:           506822

Row 17:
───────
Year:                   2024
MostViewedQuestionTitle: Warning "Third-party cookie will be blocked. Learn more in the Issues tab"
MaxViewCount:           66975

This is significantly simpler (and faster) than the equivalent Postgres query:

```sql
--Postgres
WITH yearly_views AS (
        SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CreationDate) AS Year,
        Title,
        ViewCount,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CreationDate) ORDER BY ViewCount DESC) AS rn
        FROM public.posts
        WHERE PostTypeId = 1
)
SELECT
        Year,
        Title AS MostViewedQuestionTitle,
        ViewCount AS MaxViewCount
FROM yearly_views
WHERE rn = 1
ORDER BY Year;
 year |                                                 mostviewedquestiontitle                                                 | maxviewcount

**Conditionals and Arrays**

Conditional and array functions make queries significantly simpler. The following query computes the tags (with more than 10000 occurrences) with the largest percentage increase from 2022 to 2023. Note how the following ClickHouse query is succinct thanks to the conditionals, array functions, and ability to reuse aliases in the HAVING and SELECT clauses.

```sql
--ClickHouse
SELECT  arrayJoin(arrayFilter(t -> (t != ''), splitByChar('|', Tags))) AS tag,
        countIf(toYear(CreationDate) = 2023) AS count_2023,
        countIf(toYear(CreationDate) = 2022) AS count_2022,
        ((count_2023 - count_2022) / count_2022) * 100 AS percent_change
FROM stackoverflow.posts
WHERE toYear(CreationDate) IN (2022, 2023)
GROUP BY tag
HAVING (count_2022 > 10000) AND (count_2023 > 10000)
ORDER BY percent_change DESC
LIMIT 5
