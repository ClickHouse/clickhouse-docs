## What is ClickHouse Cloud? {#what-is-clickhouse-cloud}

ClickHouse Cloud is a fully managed cloud service created by the original creators
of ClickHouse, the fastest and most popular open-source columnar online analytical
processing database.

With Cloud, infrastructure, maintenance, scaling, and operations are taken care of
for you, so that you can focus on what matters most to you, which is building value
for your organization and your customers faster.

## Benefits of ClickHouse Cloud {#benefits-of-clickhouse-cloud}

ClickHouse Cloud offers several major benefits over the open-source version:

- **Fast time to value**: Start building instantly without having to size and scale your cluster.
- **Seamless scaling**: Automatic scaling adjusts to variable workloads so you don't have to over-provision for peak usage.
- **Serverless operations**: Sit back while we take care of sizing, scaling, security, reliability, and upgrades.
- **Transparent pricing**: Pay only for what you use, with resource reservations and scaling controls.
- **Total cost of ownership**: Best price / performance ratio and low administrative overhead.
- **Broad ecosystem**: Bring your favorite data connectors, visualization tools, SQL and language clients with you.
