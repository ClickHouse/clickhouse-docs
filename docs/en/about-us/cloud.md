# ClickHouse Cloud

ClickHouse Cloud is the cloud offering created by the original creators of the popular open-source OLAP database ClickHouse. 
You can experience ClickHouse Cloud by [starting a free trial](https://console.clickhouse.cloud/signUp).

### ClickHouse Cloud benefits:

Some of the benefits of using ClickHouse Cloud are described below:

- **Fast time to value**: Start building instantly without having to size and scale your cluster.
- **Seamless scaling**: Automatic scaling adjusts to variable workloads so you don't have to over-provision for peak usage.
- **Serverless operations**: Sit back while we take care of sizing, scaling, security, reliability, and upgrades.
- **Transparent pricing**: Pay only for what you use, with resource reservations and scaling controls.
- **Total cost of ownership**: Best price / performance ratio and low administrative overhead.
- **Broad ecosystem**: Bring your favorite data connectors, visualization tools, SQL and language clients with you.

### What version of ClickHouse does ClickHouse Cloud use?

Clickhouse Cloud continuously upgrades your service to a newer version. After publishing a core database version in the open source, we do additional validation in our cloud staging environment, which typically takes 6-8 weeks before rolling out to production. The rollout is phased out by cloud service provider, service type, and region.

We offer a "Fast" Release Channel for subscribing to updates ahead of the regular release schedule. For more details, see ["Fast Release Channel"](../cloud/manage/upgrades.md/#fast-release-channel-early-upgrades).

If you rely on functionality in the earlier version, you can, in some cases, revert to the previous behavior using your service's compatibility setting.
