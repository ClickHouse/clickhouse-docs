Now that your data is in ClickHouse, it's time to analyze it, which often involves building visualizations using a BI tool. Many of the popular BI and visualization tools connect to ClickHouse. Some connect to ClickHouse out-of-the-box, while others require a connector to be installed. We have docs for some of the tools, including:

- [Grafana](./data-visualization/grafana-and-clickhouse.md)
- [Tableau](./data-visualization/tableau-and-clickhouse.md)
- [Metabase](./data-visualization/metabase-and-clickhouse.md)
- [Superset](./data-visualization/superset-and-clickhouse.md)
- [Deepnote](./data-visualization/deepnote.md)
- [Rocket BI](../connect-a-ui/rocketbi-and-clickhouse)

You also can use [SchemaSpy](https://schemaspy.org) to visualize database schema and generate html documentation for database structure. Usage details in [Clickhouse PR](https://github.com/schemaspy/schemaspy/pull/1027).
