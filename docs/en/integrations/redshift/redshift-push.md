# PUSH data from Redshift to ClickHouse

In the PUSH scenario, the idea is to leverage a third-party tool or service (either custom code or an [ETL/ELT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load#ETL_vs._ELT)) to send your data to your ClickHouse instance. For example, you can use a software like [Airbyte](https://www.airbyte.com/) to move data between your Redshift instance (as a source) and ClickHouse as a destination ([see our integration guide for Airbyte](../airbyte-and-clickhouse))

#### Pros

* It can leverage the existing catalog of connectors from the ETL/ELT software.
* Built-in capabilities to keep data in sync (append/overwrite/increment logic).
* Enable data transformation scenarios (for example, see our [integration guide for dbt](../dbt)).

#### Cons

* Users need to set up and maintain an ETL/ELT infrastructure.
* Introduces a third-party element in the architecture which can turn into a potential scalability bottleneck.
