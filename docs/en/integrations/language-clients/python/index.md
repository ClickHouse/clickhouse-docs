# Python Integration with ClickHouse Connect

## Introduction

ClickHouse Connect is a suite of Python packages providing interoperability with a wide range of Python applications.
The three primary components are:

- A low level driver in the package `clickhouse_connect.driver`. This package includes a basic client that handles
  all ClickHouse Connect requests to the ClickHouse Server, as well assorted helper classes and utility functions.
- A limited [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) dialect in the package `clickhouse_connect.cc_sqlalchemy`. This
  package focuses implements query/cursor functionality, and does not generally support SQLAlchemy DDL and ORM
  operations.
  (SQLAlchemy is targeted toward OLTP databases, and we recommend more specialized tools and frameworks to manage
  the ClickHouse OLAP database.)
- An Apache [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/) EngineSpec in the `clickhouse_connect.cc_superset`.  Note that
  this sub-package is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.  The functionality has been moved to the
  main Superset project (starting with version 2.1.0), and is included here for backward compatibility with older
  Superset versions.

This documentation is current as of the beta release 0.5.24.

:::note
The official ClickHouse Connect Python driver uses HTTP protocol for communication with the ClickHouse server.
It has some advantages (like better flexibility, HTTP-balancers support, better compatibility with JDBC-based tools, etc)
and disadvantages (like slightly lower compression and performance, and a lack of support for some complex features of the native TCP-based protocol).
For some use cases, you may consider using one of the [Community Python drivers](/docs/en/interfaces/third-party/client-libraries.md) that uses native TCP-based protocol.

¬πClickHouse Connect has been explicitly tested against the listed platforms.  In addition, untested binary wheels (with C
optimization) are built for all architectures supported by the excellent [cibuildwheel](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) project.
Finally, because ClickHouse Connect can also run as pure Python, the source installation should work on any recent
Python installation.

¬≤Again SQLAlchemy support is limited primarily to query functionality.  The full SQLAlchemy API is not supported.

¬≥ClickHouse Connect has been tested against all currently supported ClickHouse versions. Because it uses the HTTP
protocol, it should also work correctly for most other versions of ClickHouse, although there may be some
incompatibilities with certain advanced data types.


### Installation

Install ClickHouse Connect from PyPI via pip:

`pip install clickhouse-connect`

ClickHouse Connect can also be installed from source:
* `git clone` the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-connect).
* (Optional) run `pip install cython` to build and enable the C/Cython optimizations
* `cd` to the project root directory and run `pip install .`

### Support Policy

ClickHouse Connect is currently in beta and only the current beta release is actively supported. Please update to the latest
version before reported any issues. Issues should be filed in
the [GitHub project](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-connect/issues).
Future releases of ClickHouse Connect are guaranteed to be compatible with actively supported ClickHouse versions at the
time of release (generally the three most recent `stable` and two most recent `lts` releases).

### Basic Usage

### Gather your connection details

<ConnectionDetails />

#### Establish a connection

There are two examples shown for connecting to ClickHouse:
- Connecting to a ClickHouse server on localhost.
- Connecting to a ClickHouse Cloud service.

##### Use a ClickHouse Connect client instance to connect to a ClickHouse server on localhost:


```python
import clickhouse_connect

client = clickhouse_connect.get_client(host='localhost', username='default', password='password')
```

##### Use a ClickHouse Connect client instance to connect to a ClickHouse Cloud service:

:::tip
Use the connection details gathered earlier.  ClickHouse Cloud services require TLS, so use port 8443.
:::


```python
import clickhouse_connect

client = clickhouse_connect.get_client(host='HOSTNAME.clickhouse.cloud', port=8443, username='default', password='your password')
```

#### Interact with your database

To run a ClickHouse SQL command, use the client `command` method:

```python
client.command('CREATE TABLE new_table (key UInt32, value String, metric Float64) ENGINE MergeTree ORDER BY key')
```

To insert batch data, use the client `insert` method with a two-dimensional array of rows and values:

```python
row1 = [1000, 'String Value 1000', 5.233]
row2 = [2000, 'String Value 2000', -107.04]
data = [row1, row2]
client.insert('new_table', data, column_names=['key', 'value', 'metric'])
```

To retrieve data using ClickHouse SQL, use the client `query` method:

```python
result = client.query('SELECT max(key), avg(metric) FROM new_table')
result.result_rows
Out[13]: [(2000, -50.9035)]
```


## ClickHouse Connect Driver API

***Note:*** Passing keyword arguments is recommended for most api methods given the number of
possible arguments, most of which are optional.

### Client Initialization

The `clickhouse_connect.driver.client` class provides the primary interface between a Python application and the
ClickHouse database server. Use the `clickhouse_connect.get_client` function to obtain a Client instance, which accepts
the following arguments:

#### HTTPS/TLS Arguments

| Parameter        | Type | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------|------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| verify           | bool | True    | Validate the ClickHouse server TLS/SSL certificate (hostname, expiration, etc.) if using HTTPS/TLS.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ca_cert          | str  | *None*  | If *verify*=*True*, the file path to Certificate Authority root to validate ClickHouse server certificate, in .pem format. Ignored if verify is False. This is not necessary if the ClickHouse server certificate is a globally trusted root as verified by the operating system. |
| client_cert      | str  | *None*  | File path to a TLS Client certificate in .pem format (for mutual TLS authentication). The file should contain a full certificate chain, including any intermediate certificates.                                                                                                  |
| client_cert_key  | str  | *None*  | File path to the private key for the Client Certificate. Required if the private key is not included the Client Certificate key file.                                                                                                                                             |
| server_host_name | str  | *None*  | The ClickHouse server hostname as identified by the CN or SNI of its TLS certificate.  Set this to avoid SSL errors when connecting through a proxy or tunnel with a different hostname                                                                                           |

#### Settings Argument

Finally, the `settings` argument to `get_client` is used to pass additional ClickHouse settings to the server for each
client request. Note that in most cases, users with *readonly*=*1* access cannot alter settings sent with a query, so
ClickHouse Connect will drop such settings in the final request and log a warning.
The following settings apply only to HTTP queries/sessions used by ClickHouse Connect, and are not documented as general
ClickHouse settings.

| Setting           | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| buffer_size       | Buffer size (in bytes) used by ClickHouse Server before writing to the HTTP channel.                                                                                 |
| session_id        | A unique session id to associate related queries on the server. Required for temporary tables.                                                                       |
| compress          | Whether the ClickHouse server should compress the POST response data. This setting should only be used for "raw" queries.                                            |
| decompress        | Whether the data sent to ClickHouse server must be decompressed. This setting is should only be used for "raw" inserts.                                              |
| quota_key         | The quota key associated with this requests. See the ClickHouse server documentation on quotas.                                                                      |
| session_check     | Used to check the session status.                                                                                                                                    |
| session_timeout   | Number of seconds of inactivity before the identified by the session id will timeout and no longer be considered valid. Defaults to 60 seconds.                      |
| wait_end_of_query | Buffers the entire response on the ClickHouse server. This setting is required to return summary information, and is set for automatically on non-streaming queries. |

For other ClickHouse settings that can be sent with each query,
see [the ClickHouse documentation](/docs/en/operations/settings/settings.md).

#### Client Creation Examples

- Without any parameters, a ClickHouse Connect client will connect to the default HTTP port on `localhost` with the
  default user and no password:

```python
import clickhouse_connect

client = clickhouse_connect.get_client()
client.server_version
Out[2]: '22.10.1.98'
```

- Connecting to a secure (https) external ClickHouse server

```python
import clickhouse_connect

client = clickhouse_connect.get_client(host='play.clickhouse.com', secure=True, port=443, user='play', password='clickhouse')
client.command('SELECT timezone()')
Out[2]: 'Etc/UTC'
```

- Connecting with a session id and other custom connection parameters and ClickHouse settings.

```python
import clickhouse_connect

client = clickhouse_connect.get_client(host='play.clickhouse.com',
                                       user='play',
                                       password='clickhouse',
                                       port=443,
                                       session_id='example_session_1',
                                       connect_timeout=15,
                                       database='github',
                                       settings={'distributed_ddl_task_timeout':300)
client.database
Out[2]: 'github'
```

### Common Method Arguments

Several client methods use one or both of the common `parameters` and `settings` arguments. These keyword
arguments are described below.

#### Parameters Argument

ClickHouse Connect Client `query*` and `command` methods accept an optional `parameters` keyword argument used for
binding Python expressions to a ClickHouse value expression. Two sorts of binding are available.

##### Server Side Binding

ClickHouse supports [server side binding](/docs/en/interfaces/cli.md#cli-queries-with-parameters)
for most query values, where the bound value is sent separate from the query as an HTTP query parameter. ClickHouse
Connect will add the appropriate query parameters if it detects a binding expression of the form 
{&lt;name&gt;:&lt;datatype&gt;}. For server side binding, the `parameters` argument should be a Python dictionary.

- Server Side Binding with Python Dictionary, DateTime value and string value

```python
import datetime

my_date = datetime.datetime(2022, 10, 01, 15, 20, 5)

parameters = {'table': 'my_table', 'v1': my_date, 'v2': "a string with a single quote'"}
client.query('SELECT * FROM {table:Identifier} WHERE date >= {v1:DateTime} AND string ILIKE {v2:String}', parameters=parameters)

# Generates the following query on the server
# SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE date >= '2022-10-01 15:20:05' AND string ILIKE 'a string with a single quote\''
```

##### Client Side Binding

ClickHouse Connect also supports client side parameter binding which can allow more flexibility in generating templated
SQL queries. For client side binding, the `parameters` argument should be a dictionary or a sequence. Client side
binding uses the Python ["printf" style](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#old-string-formatting) string
formatting for parameter substitution.

Note that unlike server side binding, client side binding doesn't work for database identifiers such as database, table,
or column names, since Python style formatting can't distinguish between the different types of strings, and they
need to be formatted differently (backticks or double quotes for database identifiers, single quotes for data values).

- Example with Python Dictionary, DateTime value and string escaping

```python
import datetime

my_date = datetime.datetime(2022, 10, 01, 15, 20, 5)

parameters = {'v1': my_date, 'v2': "a string with a single quote'"}
client.query('SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE date >= %(v1)s AND string ILIKE %(v2)s', parameters=parameters)

# Generates the following query:
# SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE date >= '2022-10-01 15:20:05' AND string ILIKE 'a string with a single quote\''
```

- Example with Python Sequence (Tuple), Float64, and IPv4Address

```python
import ipaddress

parameters = (35200.44, ipaddress.IPv4Address(0x443d04fe))
client.query('SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE metric >= %s AND ip_address = %s', parameters=parameters)

# Generates the following query:
# SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE metric >= 35200.44 AND ip_address = '68.61.4.254''
```

#### Settings Argument

All the core SQL Client ClickHouse database server accept an optional `settings` keyword argument used for passing
ClickHouse server [user settings](/docs/en/operations/settings/settings.md) for the included SQL
statement. The `settings` argument should be a dictionary. Each item should be a ClickHouse setting name and its
associated value. Note that values will be converted to strings when sent to the server as query parameters.

As with client level settings, ClickHouse Connect will drop any settings that the server marks as *readonly*=*1*, with
an associated log message. Settings that apply only to queries via the ClickHouse HTTP interface are always valid. Those
settings are described under the `get_client` [API](#settings-argument).

Example of using ClickHouse settings:

```python
settings = {'merge_tree_min_rows_for_concurrent_read': 65535,
            'session_id': 'session_1234',
            'use_skip_indexes': False}
client.query("SELECT event_type, sum(timeout) FROM event_errors WHERE event_time > '2022-08-01'", settings=settings)
```

### Client _command_ Method

Use the `Client.command` method to send SQL queries to the ClickHouse Server that do not normally return data or return
a simple single value rather than a full dataset. This method takes the following parameters:

| Parameter     | Type             | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------|------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cmd           | str              | *Required* | A ClickHouse SQL statement that returns a single value or a single row of values.                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| parameters    | dict or iterable | *None*     | See [parameters description](#parameters-argument).                                                                                                           |
| data          | str or bytes     | *None*     | Optional data to include with the command as the POST body.                                                                                                   |
| settings      | dict             | *None*     | See [settings description](#settings-argument).                                                                                                               |
| use_database  | bool             | True       | Use the client database (specified when creating the client). False means the command will use the default ClickHouse Server database for the connected user. |
| external_data | ExternalData     | *None*     | An ExternalData object containing file or binary data to use with the query.  See [Advanced Queries (External Data)](#external-data)                          |

- _command_ can be used for DDL statements

```python
client.command('CREATE TABLE test_command (col_1 String, col_2 DateTime) Engine MergeTree ORDER BY tuple()')
client.command('SHOW CREATE TABLE test_command')
Out[6]: 'CREATE TABLE default.test_command\\n(\\n    `col_1` String,\\n    `col_2` DateTime\\n)\\nENGINE = MergeTree\\nORDER BY tuple()\\nSETTINGS index_granularity = 8192'
```

- _command_ can also be used for simple queries that return only a single row

```python
result = client.command('SELECT count() FROM system.tables')
result
Out[7]: 110
```

### Client _query_ Method

The `Client.query` method is the primary way to retrieve a single "batch" dataset from the ClickHouse Server. It
utilizes the Native
ClickHouse format over HTTP to transmit large datasets (up to approximately one million rows) efficiently. This method
takes the following parameters.

| Parameter           | Type             | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------|------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| query               | str              | *Required* | The ClickHouse SQL SELECT or DESCRIBE query.                                                                                                                                       |
| parameters          | dict or iterable | *None*     | See [parameters description](#parameters-argument).                                                                                                                                |
| settings            | dict             | *None*     | See [settings description](#settings-argument).                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                                                                                |
| query_formats       | dict             | *None*     | Datatype formatting specification for result values. See Advanced Usage (Read Formats)                                                                                             |
| column_formats      | dict             | *None*     | Datatype formatting per column. See Advanced Usage (Read Formats)                                                                                                                  |
| encoding            | str              | *None*     | Encoding used to encode ClickHouse String columns into Python strings.  Python defaults to `UTF-8` if not set.                                                                     |
| use_none            | bool             | True       | Use Python *None* type for ClickHouse nulls. If False, use a datatype default (such as 0) for ClickHouse nulls. Note - defaults to False for numpy/Pandas for performance reasons. |
| column_oriented     | bool             | False      | Return the results as a sequence of columns rather than a sequence of rows.  Helpful for transforming Python data to other column oriented data formats.                           |
| query_tz            | str              | *None*     | A timezone name from the zoneinfo database.  This timezone will be applied to all datetime or Pandas Timestamp objects returned by the query.                                      |
| column_tzs          | dict             | *None*     | A dictionary of column name to timezone name.  Like `query_tz`, but allows specifying different timezones for different columns.                                                   |
| use_extended_dtypes | bool             | True       | Use Pandas extended dtypes (like StringArray), and pandas.NA and pandas.NaT for ClickHouse NULL values.  Apples only to `query_df` and `query_df_stream` methods.                  |
| external_data       | ExternalData     | *None*     | An ExternalData object containing file or binary data to use with the query.  See [Advanced Queries (External Data)](#external-data)                                               |
| context             | QueryContext     | *None*     | A reusable QueryContext object can be used to encapsulate the above method arguments. See [Advanced Queries (QueryContexts)](#querycontexts)                                       |

#### The QueryResult Object

The base `query` method returns a QueryResult object with the following public properties:

- `result_rows` -- A matrix of the data returned in the form of a Sequence of rows, with each row element being a
  sequence of column values.
- `result_columns` -- A matrix of the data returned in the form of a Sequence of columns, with each column element being
  a
  sequence of the row values for that column
- `column_names` -- A tuple of strings representing the column names in the `result_set`
- `column_types` -- A tuple of ClickHouseType instances representing the ClickHouse data type for each column in
  the `result_columns`
- `query_id` -- The ClickHouse query_id (useful for examining the query in the `system.query_log` table)
- `summary` -- Any data returned by the `X-ClickHouse-Summary` HTTP response header
- `first_item` -- A convenience property for retrieving the first row of the response as a dictionary (keys are column
  names)
- `first_row` -- A convenience property to return the first row of the result
- `column_block_stream` -- A generator of query results in column oriented format. This property should not be
  referenced directly (see below).
- `row_block_stream` -- A generator of query results in row oriented format. This property should not be referenced
  directly (see below).
- `rows_stream` -- A generator of query results that yields a single row per invocation. This property should not be
  referenced directly (see below).

The `*_stream` properties return a Python Context that can be used as an iterator for the returned data. They should
only be
accessed indirectly using the Client `*_stream` methods. In a future release, the QueryResult object returned by the
main Client `query`
method will have consumed the stream and contain the entire populated `result_set` to provide a clean separation between
completed, "batch" results retrieved via the Client `query` method and streaming results retrieved via the
Client `query_*_stream` methods.

The complete details of streaming query results (using StreamContext objects) are outlined in
[Advanced Queries (Streaming Queries)](#streaming-queries).

### Consuming query results with Numpy, Pandas or Arrow

There are three specialized versions of the main `query` method:

- `query_np` -- This version returns a Numpy Array instead a ClickHouse Connect QueryResult.
- `query_df` -- This version returns a Pandas Dataframe instead of a ClickHouse Connect QueryResult.
- `query_arrow` -- This version returns a PyArrow Table. It utilizes the ClickHouse `Arrow` format directly, so
  it only accepts three arguments in common with the main `query method`:  `query`, `parameters`, and `settings`. In
  addition there is additional argument `use_strings` which determines whether the Arrow Table will render ClickHouse
  String types as strings (if True) or bytes (if False).

### Client Streaming Query Methods

The ClickHouse Connect Client provides multiple methods for retrieving data as a stream (implemented as a Python
generator):

- `query_column_block_stream` -- Returns query data in blocks as a sequence of columns using native Python object
- `query_row_block_stream` -- Returns query data as a block of rows using native Python object
- `query_rows_stream` -- Returns query data as a sequence of rows using native Python object
- `query_np_stream` -- Returns each ClickHouse block of query data as a Numpy array
- `query_df_stream` -- Returns each ClickHouse Block of query data as a Pandas Dataframe

Each of these methods returns a `ContextStream` object that must be opened via a `with` statement to start consuming the
stream.
See [Advanced Queries (Streaming Queries)](#streaming-queries)
for details and examples.

### Client _insert_ Method

For the common use case of inserting multiple records into ClickHouse, there is the `Client.insert` method. It takes the
following parameters:

| Parameter         | Type                              | Default    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| table             | str                               | *Required* | The ClickHouse table to insert into. The full table name (including database) is permitted.                                                                                                   |
| data              | Sequence of Sequences             | *Required* | The matrix of data to insert, either a Sequence of rows, each of which is a sequence of column values, or a Sequence of columns, each of which is a sequence of row values.                   |
| column_names      | Sequence of str, or str           | '*'        | A list of column_names for the data matrix. If '*' is used instead, ClickHouse Connect will execute a "pre-query" to retrieve all of the column names for the table.                          |
| database          | str                               | ''         | The target database of the insert. If not specified, the database for the client will be assumed.                                                                                             |
| column_types      | Sequence of ClickHouseType        | *None*     | A list of ClickHouseType instances. If neither column_types or column_type_names is specified, ClickHouse Connect will execute a "pre-query" to retrieve all the column types for the table.  |
| column_type_names | Sequence of ClickHouse type names | *None*     | A list of ClickHouse datatype names. If neither column_types or column_type_names is specified, ClickHouse Connect will execute a "pre-query" to retrieve all the column types for the table. |
| column_oriented   | bool                              | False      | If True, the `data` argument is assume to be a Sequence of columns (and no "pivot" will be necessary to insert the data). Otherwise `data` is interpreted as a Sequence of rows.              |
| settings          | dict                              | *None*     | See [settings description](#settings-argument).                                                                                                                                               |
| insert_context    | InsertContext                     | *None*     | A reusable InsertContext object can be used to encapsulate the above method arguments.  See [Advanced Inserts (InsertContexts)](#insertcontexts)                                              |

This method does not return a value. An exception will be raised if the insert fails for any reason.

There are two specialized versions of the main `insert` method:

- `insert_df` -- Instead of Python Sequence of Sequences `data` argument, the second parameter of this method requires
  a `df`
  argument that must be a Pandas Dataframe instance. ClickHouse Connect automatically processes the Dataframe as a
  column oriented datasource,
  so the `column_oriented` parameter is not required or available.
- `insert_arrow` -- Instead of a Python Sequence of Sequences `data` argument, this method requires an `arrow_table`.
  ClickHouse
  Connect passes the Arrow table unmodified to the ClickHouse server for processing, so only the `database`
  and `settings` arguments
  are available in addition to `table` and `arrow_table`.

*Note:* A Numpy array is a valid Sequence of Sequences and can be used as the `data` argument to the main `insert`
method, so a specialized method is not required.

### File Inserts

The `clickhouse_connect.driver.tools` includes the `insert_file` method that allows inserting data directly from the
file system
into an existing ClickHouse table. Parsing is delegated to the ClickHouse server.  `insert_file` accepts the following
parameters:

| Parameter    | Type            | Default           | Description                                                                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| client       | Client          | *Required*        | The `driver.Client` used to perform the insert                                                                              |
| table        | str             | *Required*        | The ClickHouse table to insert into. The full table name (including database) is permitted.                                 |
| file_path    | str             | *Required*        | The native file system path to the data file                                                                                |
| fmt          | str             | CSV, CSVWithNames | The ClickHouse Input Format of the file.  CSVWithNames is assumed if `column_names` is not provided                         |
| column_names | Sequence of str | *None*            | A list of column_names in the data file.  Not required for formats that include column names                                |
| database     | str             | *None*            | Database of the table.  Ignored if the table is fully qualified.  If not specified, the insert will use the client database |
| settings     | dict            | *None*            | See [settings description](#settings-argument).                                                                             |

For files with inconsistent data or date/time values in an unusual format, settings that apply to data imports (such as
`input_format_allow_errors_num` and `input_format_allow_errors_num`) are recognized for this method.

```python
import clickhouse_connect
from clickhouse_connect.driver.tools import insert_file

client = clickhouse_connect.get_client()
insert_file(client, 'example_table', 'my_data.csv',
            settings={'input_format_allow_errors_ratio': .2,
                      'input_format_allow_errors_num': 5})
```

### Raw API

For use cases which do not require transformation between ClickHouse data and native or third party data types and
structures,
the ClickHouse Connect client provides two methods for direct usage of the ClickHouse connection.

#### Client _raw_query_ Method

The `Client.raw_query` method allows direct usage of the ClickHouse HTTP query interface using the client connection.
The return value is an unprocessed `bytes` object. It offers a convenient wrapper with parameter binding,
error handling, retries, and settings management using a minimal interface:

| Parameter     | Type             | Default    | Description                                                                                                                           |
|---------------|------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| query         | str              | *Required* | Any valid ClickHouse query                                                                                                            |
| parameters    | dict or iterable | *None*     | See [parameters description](#parameters-argument).                                                                                   |
| settings      | dict             | *None*     | See [settings description](#settings-argument).                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                |
| fmt           | str              | *None*     | ClickHouse Output Format for the resulting bytes.  (ClickHouse uses TSV if not specified)                                             |
| use_database  | bool             | True       | Use the clickhouse-connect Client assigned database for the query context                                                             |
| external_data | ExternalData     | *None*     | An ExternalData object containing file or binary data to use with the query.  See [Advanced Queries (External Data)](#external-data)  |

It is the caller's responsibility to handle the resulting `bytes` object. Note that the `Client.query_arrow` is just a
thin wrapper around this method using the ClickHouse `Arrow` output format.

#### Client _raw_insert_ Method

The `Client.raw_insert` method allows direct inserts of `bytes` objects or `bytes` object generators using the client
connection. Because it does no processing of the insert payload, it is highly performant. The method provides options
to specify settings and insert format:

| Parameter    | Type                                   | Default    | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| table        | str                                    | *Required* | Either the simple or database qualified table name                                           |
| column_names | Sequence[str]                          | *None*     | Column names for the insert block.  Required if the `fmt` parameter does not include names   |
| insert_block | str, bytes, Generator[bytes], BinaryIO | *Required* | Data to insert.  Strings will be encoding with the client encoding.                          |
| settings     | dict                                   | *None*     | See [settings description](#settings-argument).                                              |                                                                                                                                                |
| fmt          | str                                    | *None*     | ClickHouse Input Format of the `insert_block` bytes.  (ClickHouse uses TSV if not specified) |

It is the caller's responsibility that the `insert_block` is in the specified format. ClickHouse Connect uses these raw
inserts for file uploads and PyArrow Tables, delegating parsing to the ClickHouse server.

## Multithreaded, Multiprocess, and Async/Event Driven Use Cases

ClickHouse Connect works well in multithreaded, multiprocess, and event loop driven/asynchronous applications.  All
query and insert processing occurs within a single thread, so operations are generally thread
safe.  (Parallel processing of some operations at a low level is a possible future enhancement to
overcome the performance penalty of a single thread, but even in that case thread safety will be maintained).

Because each query or insert executes maintains state in its own QueryContext or InsertContext object, respectively,
these helper objects are not thread safe, and they should not be shared between multiple processing streams.  See
the additional discussion about context objects in following sections.

Additionally, in an application that has two or more queries and/or inserts "in flight" at the same time, there are two
further considerations to keep in mind.  The first is the ClickHouse "session" associated with the query/insert, and
the second is the HTTP connection pool used by ClickHouse Connect Client instances.

### Managing ClickHouse Session Ids

Each ClickHouse query occurs within the context of a ClickHouse "session".  Sessions are currently used for two
purposes:
- To associate specific ClickHouse settings with multiple queries (see the
[user settings](/docs/en/operations/settings/settings.md)).  The ClickHouse `SET` command is used to change the
settings for the scope of a user session.
- To track [temporary tables.](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/table#temporary-tables)

By default, each query executed with a ClickHouse Connect Client instance uses the same session id to enable this
session functionality.  That is, `SET` statements and temporary table work as expected when using a single ClickHouse
client.  However, by design the ClickHouse server does not allow concurrent queries within the same session.
As a result, there are two options for a ClickHouse Connect application that will execute concurrent queries.

- Create a separate `Client` instance for each thread of execution (thread, process, or event handler) that will
have its own session id.  This is generally the best approach, as it preserves the session state for each client.
- Use a unique session id for each query.  This avoids the concurrent session problem in circumstances where
temporary tables or shared session settings are not required.  (Shared settings can also be provided
when creating the client, but these are sent with each request and not associated with a session).  The unique
session_id can be added to the `settings` dictionary for each request, or you can disable the
`autogenerate_session_id` common setting:

```python
from clickhouse_connect import common

common.set_setting('autogenerate_session_id', False)  # This should always be set before creating a client
client = clickhouse_connect.get_client(host='somehost.com', user='dbuser', password=1234)
```

In this case ClickHouse Connect will not send any session id, and a random session id will be generated by the
ClickHouse server.  Again, temporary tables and session level settings will not be available.

### Customizing the HTTP Connection Pool

ClickHouse Connect uses `urllib3` connection pools to handle the underlying HTTP connection to the server.  By default,
all client instances share the same connection pool, which is sufficient for the majority of use cases.  This default
pool maintains up to 8 HTTP Keep Alive connections to each ClickHouse server used by the application.

For large multithreaded applications, separate connection pools may be appropriate.  Customized connection pools
can be provided as the `pool_mgr` keyword argument to the main `clickhouse_connect.get_client` function:

```python
import clickhouse_connect
from clickhouse_connect.driver import httputil

big_pool_mgr = httputil.get_pool_manager(maxsize=16, num_pools=12)

client1 = clickhouse_connect.get_client(pool_mgr=big_pool_mgr)
client2 = clickhouse_connect.get_client(pool_mgr=big_pool_mgr)
```

As demonstrated by the above example, clients can share a pool manager, or a separate pool manager can be created for
each client.  For more details on the options available when creating a PoolManager, see the
[urllib3 documentation](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced-usage.html#customizing-pool-behavior).

## Querying Data with ClickHouse Connect:  Advanced Usage

### QueryContexts

ClickHouse Connect executes standard queries within a QueryContext.  The QueryContext contains the key structures that are used
to build queries against the ClickHouse database, and the configuration used to process the result into a QueryResult or other
response data structure.  That includes the query itself, parameters, settings, read formats, and other properties.

A QueryContext can be acquired using the client `create_query_context` method.  This method takes the same parameters
as the core query method.  This query context can then be passed to the `query`, `query_df`, or `query_np` methods as the `context`
keyword argument instead of any or all of the other arguments to those methods.  Note that additional arguments specified for the
method call will override any properties of QueryContext.

The clearest use case for a QueryContext is to send the same query with different binding parameter values.  All parameter values can
be updated by calling the `QueryContext.set_parameters` method with a dictionary, or any single value can be updated by calling
`QueryContext.set_parameter` with the desired `key`, `value` pair.

```python
client.create_query_context(query='SELECT value1, value2 FROM data_table WHERE key = {k:Int32}',
                            parameters={'k': 2},
                            column_oriented=True)
result = client.query(context=qc)
assert result.result_set[1][0] == 'second_value2'
qc.set_parameter('k', 1)
result = test_client.query(context=qc)
assert result.result_set[1][0] == 'first_value2'
```

Note that QueryContexts are not thread safe, but a copy can be obtained in a multithreaded environment by calling the
`QueryContext.updated_copy` method.

### Streaming Queries

#### Data Blocks
ClickHouse Connect processes all data from the primary `query` method as a stream of blocks received from the ClickHouse server.
These blocks are transmitted in the custom "Native" format to and from ClickHouse. A "block" is simply a sequence of columns of binary data,
where each column contains an equal number of data values of the specified data type. (As a columnar database, ClickHouse stores this data
in a similar form.)  The size of a block returned from a query is governed by two user settings that can be set at several levels
(user profile, user, session, or query).  They are:

- [max_block_size](/docs/en/operations/settings/settings.md/#setting-max_block_size) -- Limit on the size of the block in rows.  Default 65536.
- [preferred_block_size_bytes](/docs/en/operations/settings/settings.md/#preferred-block-size-bytes) -- Soft limit on the size of the block in bytes.  Default 1,000,0000.

Regardless of the `preferred_block_size_setting`, each block will never be more than `max_block_size` rows.  Depending on the
type of query, the actual blocks returned can be of any size.  For example, queries to a distributed table covering many shards
may contain smaller blocks retrieved directly from each shard.

When using one of the Client `query_*_stream` methods, results are returned on a block by block basis.  ClickHouse Connect only
loads a single block at a time.  This allows processing large amounts of data without the need to load all of a large result
set into memory.  Note the application should be prepared to process any number of blocks and the exact size of each block
cannot be controlled.

#### StreamContexts

Each of the `query_*_stream` methods (like `query_row_block_stream`) returns a ClickHouse `StreamContext` object, which
is a combined Python context/generator.  This is the basic usage:

```python
with client.query_row_block_stream('SELECT pickup, dropoff, pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude FROM taxi_trips') as stream:
    for block in stream:
        for row in block:
            <do something with each row of Python trip data>
```

Note that trying to use a StreamContext without a `with` statement will raise an error.  The use of a Python context ensures
that the stream (in this case, a streaming HTTP response) will be properly closed even if not all the data is consumed and/or
an exception is raised during processing.  Also, StreamContexts can only be used once to consume the stream.  Trying to use a StreamContext
after it has exited will produce a `StreamClosedError`.

You can use the `source` property of the StreamContext to access the parent `QueryResult` object, which includes column names
and types.

#### Stream Types

The `query_column_block_stream` method returns the block as a sequence of column data stored as native Python data types.  Using
the above `taxi_trips` queries, the data returned will be a list where each element of the list is another list (or tuple)
containing all the data for the  associated column.  So `block[0]` would be a tuple containing nothing but strings.  Column
oriented formats are most used for doing aggregate operations for all the values in a column, like adding up total fairs.

The `query_row_block_stream` method returns the block as a sequence of rows like a traditional relational database.  For taxi
trips, the data returned will be a list where each element of the list is another list representing a row of data.  So `block[0]`
would contain all the fields (in order) for the first taxi trip , `block[1]` would contain a row for all the fields in
the second taxi trip, and so on.  Row oriented results are normally used for display or transformation processes.

The `query_row_stream` is a convenience method that automatically moves to the next block when iterating through the stream.
Otherwise, it is identical to `query_row_block_stream`.

The `query_np_stream` method return each block as a two-dimensional Numpy Array.  Internally Numpy arrays are (usually) stored as columns,
so no distinct row or column methods are needed.  The "shape" of the numpy array will be expressed as (columns, rows).  The Numpy
library provides many methods of manipulating numpy arrays.  Note that if all columns in the query share the same Numpy dtype,
the returned numpy array will only have one dtype as well, and can be reshaped/rotated without actually changing its internal structure.

Finally, the `query_df_stream` method returns each ClickHouse Block as a two-dimensional Pandas Dataframe.  Here's an example
which shows that the StreamContext object can be used as a context in a deferred fashion (but only once).

```python
df_stream = client.query_df_stream('SELECT * FROM hits')
column_names = df_stream.source.column_names
with df_stream:
    for df in df_stream:
        <do something with the pandas DataFrame>
```

### Read Formats

Read formats control the data types of values returned from the client `query`, `query_np`, and `query_df` methods.  (The `raw_query`
and `query_arrow` do not modify incoming data from ClickHouse, so format control does not apply.)  For example, if the read format
for a UUID is changed from the default `native` format to the alternative `string` format, a ClickHouse query of `UUID` column will be
returned as string values (using the standard 8-4-4-4-12 RFC 1422 format) instead of Python UUID objects.

The "data type" argument for any formatting function can include wildcards.  The format is a single lower case string.

Read formats can be set at several levels:

- Globally, using the methods defined in the `clickhouse_connect.datatypes.format` package.  This will control the format of the
  configured datatype for all queries.
```python
from clickhouse_connect.datatypes.format import set_read_format

# Return both IPv6 and IPv4 values as strings
set_read_format('IPv*', 'string')

# Return all Date types as the underlying epoch second or epoch day
set_read_format('Date*', 'int')
```
- For an entire query, using the optional `query_formats` dictionary argument.  In that case any column (or subcolumn) of the
  specified data types(s) will use the configured format.
```python
# Return any UUID column as a string
client.query('SELECT user_id, user_uuid, device_uuid from users', query_formats={'UUID': 'string'})
```
- For the values in a specific column, using the optional `column_formats` dictionary argument.  The key is the column named as
  return by ClickHouse, and format for the data column or a second level "format" dictionary of a ClickHouse type name and a value
  of query formats.  This secondary dictionary can be used for nested column types such as Tuples or Maps.
```python
# Return IPv6 values in the `dev_address` column as strings
client.query('SELECT device_id, dev_address, gw_address from devices', column_formats={'dev_address', 'string'})
```

### External Data

ClickHouse queries can accept external data in any ClickHouse format.  This binary data is sent along with the query string to be used to process the data.  Details of
the External Data feature are [here](/docs/en/engines/table-engines/special/external-data.md).  The client `query*` methods accept an optional `external_data` parameter
to take advantage of this feature.  The value for the `external_data` parameter should be a `clickhouse_connect.driver.external.ExternalData` object.  The constructor
for that object accepts the follow arguments:

| Name      | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| file_path | str               | Path to a file on the local system path to read the external data from.  Either `file_path` or `data` is required                               | 
| file_name | str               | The name of the external data "file".  If not provided, will be determined from the `file_path` (without extensions)                            |
| data      | bytes             | The external data in binary form (instead of being read from a file).  Either `data` or `file_path` is required                                 |
| fmt       | str               | The ClickHouse [Input Format](/docs/en/sql-reference/formats.mdx) of the data.  Defaults to `TSV`                                               |
| types     | str or seq of str | A list of column data types in the external data.  If a string, types should be separated by commas.  Either `types` or `structure` is required |
| structure | str or seq of str | A list of column name + data type in the data (see examples).  Either `structure` or `types` is required                                        |
| mime_type | str               | Optional MIME type of the file data.  Currently ClickHouse ignores this HTTP subheader                                                          |


To send a query with an external CSV file containing "movie" data, and combine that data with an `directors` table already present on the ClickHouse server:

```python
import clickhouse_connect
from clickhouse_connect.driver.external import ExternalData

client = clickhouse_connect.get_client()
ext_data = ExternalData(file_path='/data/movies.csv',
                        fmt='CSV',
                        structure=['movie String', 'year UInt16', 'rating Decimal32(3)', 'director String'])
result = client.query('SELECT name, avg(rating) FROM directors INNER JOIN movies ON directors.name = movies.director GROUP BY directors.name',
                      external_data=ext_data).result_rows
```

Additional external data files can be added to the initial ExternalData object using the `add_file` method, which takes the same parameters
as the constructor.  For HTTP, all external data is transmitted as part of a `multi-part/form-data` file upload.

### Time Zones
There are multiple mechanisms for applying a time zone to ClickHouse DateTime and DateTime64 values.  Internally, the ClickHouse server always stores any DateTime or DateTime64
object as a time zone naive number representing seconds since the epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC time.  For DateTime64 values, the representation can be milliseconds, microseconds,
or nanoseconds since the epoch, depending on precision.  As a result, the application of any time zone information always occurs on the client side.  Note that this involves meaningful
extra calculation, so in performance critical applications it is recommended to treat DateTime types as epoch timestamps except for user display and conversion (Pandas Timestamps,
for example, are always a 64-bit integer representing epoch nanoseconds to improve performance).

When using time zone aware data types in queries - in particular the Python `datetime.datetime` object -- `clickhouse-connect` applies a client side time zone using the following
precedence rules:

1. If the query method parameter `client_tzs` is specified for the query, the specific column time zone is applied
2. If the ClickHouse column has timezone metadata (i.e., it is a type like DateTime64(3, 'America/Denver')), the ClickHouse column timezone is applied.  (Note this
timezone metadata is not available to clickhouse-connect for DateTime columns previous to ClickHouse version 23.2)
3. If the query method parameter `query_tz` is specified for the query, the "query timezone" is applied.
4. If a timezone setting is applied to the query or session, that timezone is applied.  (This functionality is not yet released in the ClickHouse Server)
5. Finally, if the client `apply_server_timezone` parameter has been set to True (the default), the ClickHouse server timezone is applied.

Note that if the applied timezone based on these rules is UTC, `clickhouse-connect` will _always_ return a time zone naive Python `datetime.datetime` object.  Additional timezone
information can then be added to this timezone naive object by the application code if desired.

## Inserting Data with ClickHouse Connect:  Advanced Usage

### InsertContexts

ClickHouse Connect executes all inserts within an InsertContext.  The InsertContext includes  all the values sent as arguments to
the client `insert` method.  In addition, when an InsertContext is originally constructed, ClickHouse Connect retrieves the data types
for the insert columns required for efficient Native format inserts.  By reusing the  InsertContext for multiple inserts, this "pre-query"
is avoided and inserts are executed more quickly and efficiently.

An InsertContext can be acquired using the client `create_insert_context` method.  The method takes the same arguments as
the `insert` function.  Note that only the `data` property of InsertContexts should be modified for reuse.  This is consistent
with its intended purpose of providing a reusable object for repeated inserts of new data to the same table.

```python
test_data = [[1, 'v1', 'v2'], [2, 'v3', 'v4']]
ic = test_client.create_insert_context(table='test_table', data='test_data')
client.insert(context=ic)
assert client.command('SELECT count() FROM test_table') == 2
new_data = [[3, 'v5', 'v6'], [4, 'v7', 'v8']]
ic.data = new_data
client.insert(context=ic)
qr = test_client.query('SELECT * FROM test_table ORDER BY key DESC')
assert qr.row_count == 4
assert qr[0][0] == 4
```

InsertContexts include mutable state that is updated during the insert process, so they are not thread safe.


### Write Formats
Write formats are currently implemented for limited number of types.  In most cases ClickHouse Connect will attempt to
automatically determine the correct write format for a column by checking the type of the first (non-null) data value.
For example, if inserting into a DateTime column, and the first insert value of the column is a Python integer, ClickHouse
Connect will directly insert the integer value under the assumption that it's actually an epoch second.

In most cases, it is unnecessary to override the write format for a data type, but the associated methods in the
`clickhouse_connect.datatypes.format` package can be used to do so at a global level.

## Additional Options

ClickHouse Connect provides a number of additional options for advanced use cases

### Global Settings

There are a small number of settings that control ClickHouse Connect behavior globally.  They are accessed from the top
level `common` package:

```python
from clickhouse_connect import common

common.set_setting('autogenerate_session_id', False)
common.get_setting('invalid_setting_action')
'drop'
```

:::note
These common settings `autogenerate_session_id`, `product_name`, and `readonly` should _always_ be modified before
creating a client  with the `clickhouse_connect.get_client` method.  Changing these settings after client creation does
not affect the behavior of existing clients.
:::

Eight global settings are currently defined:

| Setting Name            | Default | Options                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| autogenerate_session_id | True    | True, False             | Autogenerate a new UUID(1) session id (if not provided) for each client session.  If no session id is provided (either at the client or query level, ClickHouse will generate random internal id for each query                                               |
| invalid_setting_action  | 'error' | 'drop', 'send', 'error' | Action to take when an invalid or readonly setting is provided (either for the client session or query).  If `drop`, the setting will be ignored, if `send`, the setting will be sent to ClickHouse, if `error` a client side ProgrammingError will be raised |
| dict_parameter_format   | 'json'  | 'json', 'map'           | This controls whether parameterized queries convert a Python dictionary to JSON or ClickHouse Map syntax. `json` should be used for inserts into JSON columns, `map` for ClickHouse Map columns                                                               |
| product_name            |         |                         | A string that is passed with the query to clickhouse for tracking the app using ClickHouse Connect.  Should be in the form &lt;product name;&gl/&lt;product version&gt;                                                                                       |
| max_connection_age      | 600     |                         | Maximum seconds that an HTTP Keep Alive connection will be kept open/reused.  This prevents bunching of connections against a single ClickHouse node behind a load balancer/proxy.  Defaults to 10 minutes.                                                   |
| readonly                | 0       | 0, 1                    | Implied "read_only" ClickHouse settings for versions prior to 19.17.  Can be set to match the ClickHouse "read_only" value for settings to allow operation with very old ClickHouse versions                                                                  |
| use_protocol_version    | True    | True, False             | Use the client protocol version. This is needed for DateTime timezone columns but breaks with the current version of chproxy                                                                                                                                      |
| max_error_size          | 1024    |                         | Maximum number of characters that will be returned in a client error messages. Use 0 for this setting to get the full ClickHouse error message. Defaults to 1024 characters.                                                                               |

### Compression

ClickHouse Connect supports lz4, zstd, brotli, and gzip compression for both query results and inserts.  Always keep in mind
that using compression usually involves a tradeoff between network bandwidth/transfer speed against CPU usage (both on the
client and the server.)

To receive compressed data, the ClickHouse server `enable_http_compression` must be set to 1, or the user must have
permission to change the setting on a "per query" basis.

Compression is controlled by the `compress` parameter when calling the `clickhouse_connect.get_client` factory method.
By default, `compress` is set to `True`, which will trigger the default compression settings.  For queries executed
with the `query`, `query_np`, and `query_df` client methods,  ClickHouse Connect will add the `Accept-Encoding` header with
the `lz4`, `zstd`, `br` (brotli, if the brotli library is installed), `gzip`, and `deflate` encodings to queries executed
with the `query` client method (and indirectly, `query_np` and `query_df`.  (For the majority of requests the ClickHouse
server will return with a `zstd` compressed payload.)  For inserts, by default ClickHouse Connect will compress insert
blocks with `lz4` compression, and send the `Content-Encoding: lz4` HTTP header.

The `get_client` `compress` parameter can also be set to a specific compression method, one of `lz4`, `zstd`, `br`, or
`gzip`.  That method will then be used for both inserts and query results (if supported by the ClickHouse server.)  The required
`zstd` and `lz4` compression libraries are now installed by default with ClickHouse Connect.  If `br`/brotli is specified,
the brotli library must be installed separately.

Note that the `raw*` client methods don't use the compression specified by the client configuration.

We also recommend against using `gzip` compression, as it is significantly slower than the alternatives for both compressing
and decompressing data.

### HTTP Proxy Support

ClickHouse Connect adds basic HTTP proxy support using the urllib3 library.  It recognizes the standard `HTTP_PROXY` and
`HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables.  Note that using these environment variables will apply to any client created with the
`clickhouse_connect.get_client` method.  Alternatively, to configure per client, you can use the `http_proxy` or `https_proxy`
arguments to the get_client method. For details on the implementation of HTTP Proxy support, see the [urllib3](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced-usage.html#http-and-https-proxies)
documentation.

To use a Socks proxy, you can send a urllib3 SOCKSProxyManager as the `pool_mgr` argument to `get_client`.  Note that
this will require installing the PySocks library either directly or using the `[socks]` option for the urllib3 dependency.
