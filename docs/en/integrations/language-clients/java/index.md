# Java Clients Overview

- [Client 0.8+](./client-v2.md)
- [JDBC 0.8+](./jdbc-v2.md)
- [R2DBC Driver](./r2dbc.md)

## ClickHouse Client

Java client is a library implementing own API that abstracts details of network communications with ClickHouse server. Currently HTTP Interface is supported only. The library provide utilities to work with different ClickHouse formats and other related functions.

Java Client was developed far back in 2015. Its codebase became very hard to maintain, API is confusing, it is hard to optimize it further. So we have refactored it in 2024 into a new component  `client-v2`. It has clear API, lighter codebase and more performance improvements, better ClickHouse formats support (RowBinary & Native mainly). JDBC will use this client in near feature.

JDBC Drive inherits same features as underlying client implementation. Other JDBC features are listed on its [page](/docs/en/integrations/java/jdbc-driver#features).

### Compatibility

- All projects in this repo are tested with all [active LTS versions](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Arelease) of ClickHouse.
- [Support policy](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/SECURITY.md#security-change-log-and-support)
- We recommend to upgrade client continuously to not miss security fixes and new improvements
- If you have an issue with migration to v2 API - [create an issue](https://github.com/ClickHouse/clickhouse-java/issues/new?assignees=&labels=v2-feedback&projects=&template=v2-feedback.md&title=) and we will respond!

### Logging

Our Java language client uses [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) for logging. You can use any SLF4J-compatible logging framework, such as `Logback` or `Log4j`. 
For example, if you are using Maven you could add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml title="pom.xml"
<dependencies>
    <!-- SLF4J API -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.16</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
    </dependency>

    <!-- Logback Core -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
        <artifactId>logback-core</artifactId>
        <version>1.5.16</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
    </dependency>

    <!-- Logback Classic (bridges SLF4J to Logback) -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
        <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
        <version>1.5.16</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Configuring Logging

This is going to depend on the logging framework you are using. For example, if you are using `Logback`, you could configure logging in a file called `logback.xml`:

```xml title="logback.xml"
<configuration>
    <!-- Console Appender -->
    <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder>
            <pattern>[%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}] [%level] [%thread] %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <!-- File Appender -->
    <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
        <file>logs/app.log</file>
        <append>true</append>
        <encoder>
            <pattern>[%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}] [%level] [%thread] %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <!-- Root Logger -->
    <root level="info">
        <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
        <appender-ref ref="FILE" />
    </root>

    <!-- Custom Log Levels for Specific Packages -->
    <logger name="com.clickhouse" level="info" />
</configuration>
```
