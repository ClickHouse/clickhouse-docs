# Using a 3rd-party ETL Tool

<img src={require('./images/third-party-01.png').default} class="image" alt="Migrating Self-managed ClickHouse" style={{width: '40%', padding: '30px'}}/>

A great option for moving data from an external data source into ClickHouse is to use one of the many popular ETL and ELT. We have docs that cover the following:

- [Airbyte](/docs/en/integrations/data-ingestion/etl-tools/airbyte-and-clickhouse.md)
- [dbt](/docs/en/integrations/data-ingestion/etl-tools/dbt/index.md)
- [Vector](/docs/en/integrations/data-ingestion/etl-tools/vector-to-clickhouse.md)

But there are many other ETL/ELT tools that integrate with ClickHouse, so check your favorite tool's documentation for details.
