# Integrating PostgreSQL with ClickHouse Cloud
PeerDB has joined forces with ClickHouse to offer the fastest Postgres CDC available! To get started, create an account on [PeerDB Cloud](https://www.peerdb.io/) and refer to [the documentation](https://docs.peerdb.io/connect/clickhouse/clickhouse-cloud) for setup instructions for ClickHouse Cloud.

In the coming months, we'll be working on making PostgreSQL CDC a fully integrated solution in ClickPipes.
