# Integrate Google Cloud Storage with ClickHouse

ClickHouse recognizes that GCS represents an attractive storage solution for users seeking to separate storage and compute. To help achieve this, support is provided for using GCS as the storage for a MergeTree engine. This will enable users to exploit the scalability and cost benefits of GCS, and the insert and query performance of the MergeTree engine.

### Creating a Disk

To utilize a GCS bucket as a disk, we must first declare it within the ClickHouse configuration in a file under `conf.d`. An example of a GCS disk declaration is shown below.  This configuration includes multiple sections to configure the GCS "disk", the cache, and the policy that is specified in DDL queries when tables are to be created on the GCS disk.  Each of these are described below.

#### storage_configuration > disks > gcs

This part of the configuration is shown in the highlighted section and specifies that:
- Batch deletes are not to be performed.  GCS does not currently support batch deletes, so the autodetect is disabled to suppress error messages.
- The type of the disk is `s3` because the S3 API is in use.
- The endpoint as provided by GCS
- The service account HMAC key and secret
- The metadata path on the local disk

```xml
<clickhouse>
    <storage_configuration>
        <disks>
            <gcs>
	    <!--highlight-start-->
                <support_batch_delete>false</support_batch_delete>
                <type>s3</type>
                <endpoint>https://storage.googleapis.com/BUCKET NAME/FOLDER NAME/</endpoint>
                <access_key_id>SERVICE ACCOUNT HMAC KEY</access_key_id>
                <secret_access_key>SERVICE ACCOUNT HMAC SECRET</secret_access_key>
                <metadata_path>/var/lib/clickhouse/disks/gcs/</metadata_path>
	    <!--highlight-end-->
            </gcs>
        </disks>
        <policies>
            <gcs_main>
                <volumes>
                    <main>
                        <disk>gcs</disk>
                    </main>
                </volumes>
            </gcs_main>
        </policies>
    </storage_configuration>
</clickhouse>
```
#### storage_configuration > disks > cache

The example configuration highlighted below enables a 10Gi memory cache for the disk `gcs`.

```xml
<clickhouse>
    <storage_configuration>
        <disks>
            <gcs>
                <support_batch_delete>false</support_batch_delete>
                <type>s3</type>
                <endpoint>https://storage.googleapis.com/BUCKET NAME/FOLDER NAME/</endpoint>
                <access_key_id>SERVICE ACCOUNT HMAC KEY</access_key_id>
                <secret_access_key>SERVICE ACCOUNT HMAC SECRET</secret_access_key>
                <metadata_path>/var/lib/clickhouse/disks/gcs/</metadata_path>
            </gcs>
	    <!--highlight-start-->
	    <gcs_cache>
                <type>cache</type>
                <disk>gcs</disk>
                <path>/var/lib/clickhouse/disks/gcs_cache/</path>
                <max_size>10Gi</max_size>
            </gcs_cache>
	    <!--highlight-end-->
        </disks>
        <policies>
            <gcs_main>
                <volumes>
                    <main>
                        <disk>gcs_cache</disk>
                    </main>
                </volumes>
            </gcs_main>
        </policies>
    </storage_configuration>
</clickhouse>
```
#### storage_configuration > policies > gcs_main

Storage configuration policies allow choosing where data is stored.  The policy highlighted below allows data to be stored on the disk `gcs` by specifying the policy `gcs_main`.  For example, `CREATE TABLE ... SETTINGS storage_policy='gcs_main'`.

```xml
<clickhouse>
    <storage_configuration>
        <disks>
            <gcs>
                <support_batch_delete>false</support_batch_delete>
                <type>s3</type>
                <endpoint>https://storage.googleapis.com/BUCKET NAME/FOLDER NAME/</endpoint>
                <access_key_id>SERVICE ACCOUNT HMAC KEY</access_key_id>
                <secret_access_key>SERVICE ACCOUNT HMAC SECRET</secret_access_key>
                <metadata_path>/var/lib/clickhouse/disks/gcs/</metadata_path>
            </gcs>
        </disks>
        <policies>
	    <!--highlight-start-->
            <gcs_main>
                <volumes>
                    <main>
                        <disk>gcs</disk>
                    </main>
                </volumes>
            </gcs_main>
	    <!--highlight-end-->
        </policies>
    </storage_configuration>
</clickhouse>
```

A complete list of settings relevant to this disk declaration can be found [here](/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree.md/#table_engine-mergetree-s3).

### Creating a table

Assuming you have configured your disk to use a bucket with write access, you should be able to create a table such as in the example below. For purposes of brevity, we use a subset of the NYC taxi columns and stream data directly to the GCS-backed table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE trips_gcs
(
   `trip_id` UInt32,
   `pickup_date` Date,
   `pickup_datetime` DateTime,
   `dropoff_datetime` DateTime,
   `pickup_longitude` Float64,
   `pickup_latitude` Float64,
   `dropoff_longitude` Float64,
   `dropoff_latitude` Float64,
   `passenger_count` UInt8,
   `trip_distance` Float64,
   `tip_amount` Float32,
   `total_amount` Float32,
   `payment_type` Enum8('UNK' = 0, 'CSH' = 1, 'CRE' = 2, 'NOC' = 3, 'DIS' = 4)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(pickup_date)
ORDER BY pickup_datetime
# highlight-next-line
SETTINGS storage_policy='gcs_main'
```

```sql
INSERT INTO trips_gcs SELECT trip_id, pickup_date, pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude, passenger_count, trip_distance, tip_amount, total_amount, payment_type FROM s3('https://ch-nyc-taxi.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/tsv/trips_{0..9}.tsv.gz', 'TabSeparatedWithNames') LIMIT 1000000;
```

Depending on the hardware, this latter insert of 1m rows may take a few minutes to execute. You can confirm the progress via the system.processes table. Feel free to adjust the row count up to the limit of 10m and explore some sample queries.

```sql
SELECT passenger_count, avg(tip_amount) as avg_tip, avg(total_amount) as avg_amount FROM trips_gcs GROUP BY passenger_count;
```

### Handling Replication

Replication with GCS disks can be accomplished by using the `ReplicatedMergeTree` table engine.  See the [replicating a single shard across two GCP regions using GCS](#gcs-multi-region) guide for details.


### Learn More

The [Cloud Storage XML API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/xml-api/overview) is interoperable with some tools and libraries that work with services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

## Using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) {#gcs-multi-region}

:::tip
Object storage is used by default in ClickHouse Cloud, you do not need to follow this procedure if you are running in ClickHouse Cloud.
:::

### Plan the deployment

This tutorial is written to describe a replicated ClickHouse deployment running in Google Cloud and using Google Cloud Storage (GCS) as the ClickHouse storage disk "type".

In the tutorial, you will deploy ClickHouse server nodes in Google Cloud Engine VMs, each with an associated GCS bucket for storage.  Replication is coordinated by a set of ClickHouse Keeper nodes, also deployed as VMs.

Sample requirements for high availability:
- Two ClickHouse server nodes, in two GCP regions
- Two GCS buckets, deployed in the same regions as the two ClickHouse server nodes
- Three ClickHouse Keeper nodes, two of them are deployed in the same regions as the ClickHouse server nodes. The third can be in the same region as one of the first two Keeper nodes, but in a different availability zone.

ClickHouse Keeper requires two nodes to function, hence a requirement for three nodes for high availability.

### Prepare VMs

Deploy five VMS in three regions:

| Region | ClickHouse Server | Bucket            | ClickHouse Keeper |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1      | chnode1           | bucket_regionname | keepernode1       |
| 2      | chnode2           | bucket_regionname | keepernode2       |
| 3 `*`  |                   |                   | keepernode3       |

`*` This can be a different availability zone in the same region as 1 or 2.

#### Deploy ClickHouse

Deploy ClickHouse on two hosts, in the sample configurations these are named `chnode1`, `chnode2`.

Place `chnode1` in one GCP region, and `chnode2` in a second.  In this guide `us-east1` and `us-east4` are used for the compute engine VMs, and also for GCS buckets.

:::note
Do not start `clickhouse server` until after it is configured.  Just install it.
:::

Refer to the [installation instructions](/docs/en/getting-started/install.md/#available-installation-options) when performing the deployment steps on the ClickHouse server nodes and ClickHouse Keeper nodes.

#### Deploy ClickHouse Keeper

Deploy ClickHouse Keeper on three hosts, in the sample configurations these are named `keepernode1`, `keepernode2`, and `keepernode3`.  `keepernode1` can be deployed in the same region as `chnode1`, `keepernode2` with `chnode2`, and `keepernode3` in either region, but in a different availability zone from the ClickHouse node in that region.

Refer to the [installation instructions](/docs/en/getting-started/install.md/#available-installation-options) when performing the deployment steps on the ClickHouse server nodes and ClickHouse Keeper nodes.

:::note
ClickHouse Keeper is installed in the same way as ClickHouse, as it can be run with ClickHouse server, or standalone.  Running Keeper standalone gives more flexibility when scaling out or upgrading.
:::

Once you deploy ClickHouse on the three Keeper nodes run these commands to prep the directories for configuration and operation in standalone mode:

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/clickhouse-keeper
sudo chown clickhouse:clickhouse /etc/clickhouse-keeper
sudo chmod 700 /etc/clickhouse-keeper
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/clickhouse/coordination
sudo chown -R clickhouse:clickhouse /var/lib/clickhouse
```

### Create two buckets

The two ClickHouse servers will be located in different regions for high availability.  Each will have a GCS bucket in the same region.

In **Cloud Storage > Buckets** choose **CREATE BUCKET**. For this tutorial two buckets are created, one in each of `us-east1` and `us-east4`.  The buckets are single region, standard storage class, and not public.  When prompted, enable public access prevention.  Do not create folders, they will be created when ClickHouse writes to the storage.

#### ch_bucket_us_east4

![Add a bucket](@site/docs/en/integrations/data-ingestion/s3/images/GCS-bucket-2.png)

### Generate an Access key

#### Create a service account HMAC key and secret

Open **Cloud Storage > Settings > Interoperability** and either choose an existing **Access key**, or **CREATE A KEY FOR A SERVICE ACCOUNT**.  This guide covers the path for creating a new key for a new service account.

![Add a bucket](@site/docs/en/integrations/data-ingestion/s3/images/GCS-create-a-service-account-key.png)

#### Add a new service account

If this is a project with no existing service account, **CREATE NEW ACCOUNT**.

![Add a bucket](@site/docs/en/integrations/data-ingestion/s3/images/GCS-create-service-account-0.png)

There are three steps to creating the service account, in the first step give the account a meaningful name, ID, and description.

![Add a bucket](@site/docs/en/integrations/data-ingestion/s3/images/GCS-create-service-account-a.png)

In the Interoperability settings dialog the IAM role **Storage Object Admin** role is recommended; select that role in step two.

![Add a bucket](@site/docs/en/integrations/data-ingestion/s3/images/GCS-create-service-account-2.png)

Step three is optional and not used in this guide.  You may allow users to have these privileges based on your policies.

![Add a bucket](@site/docs/en/integrations/data-ingestion/s3/images/GCS-create-service-account-3.png)

The service account HMAC key will be displayed.  Save this information, as it will be used in the ClickHouse configuration.

![Add a bucket](@site/docs/en/integrations/data-ingestion/s3/images/GCS-guide-key.png)


### Configure ClickHouse Keeper

All of the ClickHouse Keeper nodes have the same configuration file except for the `server_id` line (first highlighted line below).  Modify the file with the hostnames for your ClickHouse Keeper servers, and on each of the servers set the `server_id` to match the appropriate `server` entry in the `raft_configuration`.  Since this example has `server_id` set to `3`, we have highlighted the matching lines in the `raft_configuration`.

- Edit the file with your hostnames, and make sure that they resolve from the ClickHouse server nodes and the Keeper nodes
- Copy the file into place (`/etc/clickhouse-keeper/keeper-config.xml` on each of the Keeper servers
- Edit the `server_id` on each machine, based on its entry number in the `raft_configuration`

```xml title=/etc/clickhouse-keeper/keeper-config.xml
<clickhouse>
    <listen_host>0.0.0.0</listen_host>

    <keeper_server>
        <tcp_port>9181</tcp_port>
<!--highlight-next-line-->
        <server_id>3</server_id>
        <log_storage_path>/var/lib/clickhouse/coordination/log</log_storage_path>
        <snapshot_storage_path>/var/lib/clickhouse/coordination/snapshots</snapshot_storage_path>

        <coordination_settings>
            <operation_timeout_ms>10000</operation_timeout_ms>
            <session_timeout_ms>30000</session_timeout_ms>
            <raft_logs_level>warning</raft_logs_level>
        </coordination_settings>

        <raft_configuration>
            <server>
                <id>1</id>
                <hostname>keepernode1.us-east1-b.c.clickhousegcs-374921.internal</hostname>
                <port>9234</port>
            </server>
            <server>
                <id>2</id>
                <hostname>keepernode2.us-east4-c.c.clickhousegcs-374921.internal</hostname>
                <port>9234</port>
            </server>
<!--highlight-start-->
            <server>
                <id>3</id>
                <hostname>keepernode3.us-east5-a.c.clickhousegcs-374921.internal</hostname>
                <port>9234</port>
            </server>
<!--highlight-end-->
        </raft_configuration>
    </keeper_server>
</clickhouse>
```


### Configure ClickHouse Server

:::note best practice
Some of the steps in this guide will ask you to place a configuration file in `/etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/`.  This is the default location on Linux systems for configuration override files.  When you put these files into that directory ClickHouse will merge the content with the default configuration.  By placing these files in the `config.d` directory you will avoid losing your configuration during an upgrade.
:::

#### Networking
By default, ClickHouse listens on the loopback interface, in a replicated setup networking between machines is necessary.  Listen on all interfaces:

```xml title=/etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/network.xml
<clickhouse>
    <listen_host>0.0.0.0</listen_host>
</clickhouse>
```

#### Remote ClickHouse Keeper servers

Replication is coordinated by ClickHouse Keeper.  This configuration file identifies the ClickHouse Keeper nodes by hostname and port number.

- Edit the hostnames to match your Keeper hosts


```xml title=/etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/use-keeper.xml
<clickhouse>
    <zookeeper>
        <node index="1">
            <host>keepernode1.us-east1-b.c.clickhousegcs-374921.internal</host>
            <port>9181</port>
        </node>
        <node index="2">
            <host>keepernode2.us-east4-c.c.clickhousegcs-374921.internal</host>
            <port>9181</port>
        </node>
        <node index="3">
            <host>keepernode3.us-east5-a.c.clickhousegcs-374921.internal</host>
            <port>9181</port>
        </node>
    </zookeeper>
</clickhouse>
```


#### Remote ClickHouse servers

This file configures the hostname and port of each ClickHouse server in the cluster.  The default configuration file contains sample cluster definitions, in order to show only the clusters that are completely configured the tag `replace="true"` is added to the `remote_servers` entry so that when this configuration is merged with the default it replaces the `remote_servers` section instead of adding to it.

- Edit the file with your hostnames, and make sure that they resolve from the ClickHouse server nodes

```xml title=/etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/remote-servers.xml
<clickhouse>
    <remote_servers replace="true">
        <cluster_1S_2R>
            <shard>
                <replica>
                    <host>chnode1.us-east1-b.c.clickhousegcs-374921.internal</host>
                    <port>9000</port>
                </replica>
                <replica>
                    <host>chnode2.us-east4-c.c.clickhousegcs-374921.internal</host>
                    <port>9000</port>
                </replica>
            </shard>
        </cluster_1S_2R>
    </remote_servers>
</clickhouse>
```

#### Replica identification

This file configures settings related to the ClickHouse Keeper path.  Specifically the macros used to identify which replica the data is part of.  On one server the replica should be specified as `replica_1`, and on the other server `replica_2`.  The names can be changed, based on our example of one replica being stored in South Carolina and the other in Northern Virginia the values could be `carolina` and `virginia`; just make sure that they are different on each machine.

```xml title=/etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/macros.xml
<clickhouse>
    <distributed_ddl>
            <path>/clickhouse/task_queue/ddl</path>
    </distributed_ddl>
    <macros>
        <cluster>cluster_1S_2R</cluster>
        <shard>1</shard>
<!--highlight-next-line-->
        <replica>replica_1</replica>
    </macros>
</clickhouse>
```

#### Storage in GCS

ClickHouse storage configuration includes `disks` and `policies`. The disk being configured below is named `gcs`, and is of `type` `s3`.  The type is s3 because ClickHouse accesses the GCS bucket as if it was an AWS S3 bucket.  Two copies of this configuration will be needed, one for each of the ClickHouse server nodes.

These substitutions should be made in the configuration below.

These substitutions differ between the two ClickHouse server nodes:
- `REPLICA 1 BUCKET` should be set to the name of the bucket in the same region as the server
- `REPLICA 1 FOLDER` should be changed to `replica_1` on one of the servers, and `replica_2` on the other

These substitutions are common across the two nodes:
- The `access_key_id` should be set to the HMAC Key generated earlier
- The `secret_access_key` should be set to HMAC Secret generated earlier

```xml title=/etc/clickhouse-server/config.d/storage.xml
<clickhouse>
    <storage_configuration>
        <disks>
            <gcs>
                <support_batch_delete>false</support_batch_delete>
                <type>s3</type>
                <endpoint>https://storage.googleapis.com/REPLICA 1 BUCKET/REPLICA 1 FOLDER/</endpoint>
                <access_key_id>SERVICE ACCOUNT HMAC KEY</access_key_id>
                <secret_access_key>SERVICE ACCOUNT HMAC SECRET</secret_access_key>
                <metadata_path>/var/lib/clickhouse/disks/gcs/</metadata_path>
            </gcs>
	    <cache>
                <type>cache</type>
                <disk>gcs</disk>
                <path>/var/lib/clickhouse/disks/gcs_cache/</path>
                <max_size>10Gi</max_size>
            </cache>
        </disks>
        <policies>
            <gcs_main>
                <volumes>
                    <main>
                        <disk>gcs</disk>
                    </main>
                </volumes>
            </gcs_main>
        </policies>
    </storage_configuration>
</clickhouse>
```

### Start ClickHouse Keeper

```bash
sudo -u clickhouse clickhouse-keeper --config-file=/etc/clickhouse-keeper/keeper-config.xml --daemon
```
#### Check ClickHouse Keeper status

Send commands to the ClickHouse Keeper with `netcat`.  For example, `mntr` returns the state of the ClickHouse Keeper cluster.  If you run the command on each of the Keeper nodes you will see that one is a leader, and the other two are followers:

```bash
echo mntr | nc localhost 9181
```
```response

### Start ClickHouse server

On `chnode1` and `chnode` run:
```bash
sudo service clickhouse-server start
```
```bash
sudo service clickhouse-server status
```

### Verification

#### Verify disk configuration

`system.disks` should contain records for each disk:
- default
- gcs
- cache

```sql
SELECT *
FROM system.disks
FORMAT Vertical
```
```response

#### Verify that data can be inserted

```sql
INSERT INTO trips SELECT
    trip_id,
    pickup_date,
    pickup_datetime,
    dropoff_datetime,
    pickup_longitude,
    pickup_latitude,

FROM s3('https://ch-nyc-taxi.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/tsv/trips_{0..9}.tsv.gz', 'TabSeparatedWithNames')
LIMIT 1000000
```

#### Verify that the storage policy `gcs_main` is used for the table.
```sql

    metadata_path,
    storage_policy,
    formatReadableSize(total_bytes)

#### Verify in Google Cloud Console

Looking at the buckets you will see that a folder was created in each bucket with the name that was used in the `storage.xml` configuration file.  Expand the folders and you will see many files, representing the data partitions.
