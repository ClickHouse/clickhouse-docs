[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a popular library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
In version 2 of chDB, we've improved the performance of querying Pandas DataFrames and introduced the `Python` table function.
In this guide, we will learn how to query Pandas using the `Python` table function.

## Setup

Let's first create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

And now we'll install chDB.
Make sure you have version 2.0.2 or higher:

```bash
pip install "chdb>=2.0.2"
```

And now we're going to install Pandas and a couple of other libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas requests ipython
```

We're going to use `ipython` to run the commands in the rest of the guide, which you can launch by running:

```bash
ipython
```

You can also use the code in a Python script or in your favorite notebook.

## Creating a Pandas DataFrame from a URL

We're going to query some data from the [StatsBomb GitHub repository](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file).
Let's first import requests and pandas:

```python
import requests
import pandas as pd
```

Then, we'll load one of the matches JSON files into a DataFrame:

```python
response = requests.get(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsbomb/open-data/master/data/matches/223/282.json"
)
matches_df = pd.json_normalize(response.json(), sep='_')
```

Let's have a look what data we'll be working with:

```python
matches_df.iloc[0]
```

```text
match_id                                                                  3943077
match_date                                                             2024-07-15

```

Next, we'll load one of the events JSON files and also add a column called `match_id` to that DataFrame:

```python
response = requests.get(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsbomb/open-data/master/data/events/3943077.json"
)
events_df = pd.json_normalize(response.json(), sep='_')
events_df["match_id"] = 3943077
```

And again, let's have a look at the first row:

```python
with pd.option_context("display.max_rows", None):
    first_row = events_df.iloc[0]
    non_nan_columns = first_row[first_row.notna()].T
    display(non_nan_columns)
```

```text

```

## Querying Pandas DataFrames

Next, let's see how to query these DataFrames using chDB. 
We'll import the library:

```python
import chdb
```

We can query Pandas DataFrames by using the `Python` table function:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Python(<name-of-variable>)
```

So, if we wanted to list the columns in `matches_df`, we could write the following:

```python
chdb.query("""
DESCRIBE Python(matches_df)
SETTINGS describe_compact_output=1
""", "DataFrame")
```

```text
                              name    type
0                         match_id   Int64
1                       match_date  String
2                         kick_off  String
3                       home_score   Int64
4                       away_score   Int64
5                     match_status  String
6                 match_status_360  String
7                     last_updated  String
8                 last_updated_360  String
9                       match_week   Int64
10      competition_competition_id   Int64
11        competition_country_name  String
12    competition_competition_name  String
13                season_season_id   Int64
14              season_season_name  String
15          home_team_home_team_id   Int64
16        home_team_home_team_name  String
17      home_team_home_team_gender  String
18       home_team_home_team_group  String
19            home_team_country_id   Int64
20          home_team_country_name  String
21              home_team_managers  String
22          away_team_away_team_id   Int64
23        away_team_away_team_name  String
24      away_team_away_team_gender  String
25       away_team_away_team_group  String
26            away_team_country_id   Int64
27          away_team_country_name  String
28              away_team_managers  String
29           metadata_data_version  String
30  metadata_shot_fidelity_version  String
31    metadata_xy_fidelity_version  String
32            competition_stage_id   Int64
33          competition_stage_name  String
34                      stadium_id   Int64
35                    stadium_name  String
36              stadium_country_id   Int64
37            stadium_country_name  String
38                      referee_id   Int64
39                    referee_name  String
40              referee_country_id   Int64
41            referee_country_name  String
```

We could then find out which referees have officiated more than one match by writing the following query:

```python
chdb.query("""
SELECT referee_name, count() AS count
FROM Python(matches_df)
GROUP BY ALL
HAVING count > 1
ORDER BY count DESC
""", "DataFrame")
```

```text
                    referee_name  count
0  César Arturo Ramos Palazuelos      3
1               Maurizio Mariani      3
2               Piero Maza Gomez      3
3     Mario Alberto Escobar Toca      2
4  Wilmar Alexander Roldán Pérez      2
5          Jesús Valenzuela Sáez      2
6         Wilton Pereira Sampaio      2
7                  Darío Herrera      2
8                 Andrés Matonte      2
9                  Raphael Claus      2
```

Now, let's explore `events_df`.

```python
chdb.query("""
SELECT pass_recipient_name, count()
FROM Python(events_df)
WHERE type_name = 'Pass' AND pass_recipient_name <> ''
GROUP BY ALL
ORDER BY count() DESC
LIMIT 10
""", "DataFrame")
```

```text
               pass_recipient_name  count()
0            Davinson Sánchez Mina       76
1  Ángel Fabián Di María Hernández       64
2              Alexis Mac Allister       62
3                   Enzo Fernandez       57
4      James David Rodríguez Rubio       56
5      Johan Andrés Mojica Palacio       55
6           Rodrigo Javier De Paul       54
7     Jefferson Andrés Lerma Solís       53
8        Jhon Adolfo Arias Andrade       52
9  Carlos Eccehomo Cuesta Figueroa       50
```

## Joining Pandas DataFrames 

We can also join DataFrames together in a query.
For example, to get an overview of the match, we could write the following query:

```python
chdb.query("""
SELECT home_team_home_team_name, away_team_away_team_name, home_score, away_score,
       countIf(type_name = 'Pass' AND possession_team_id=home_team_home_team_id) AS home_passes,
       countIf(type_name = 'Pass' AND possession_team_id=away_team_away_team_id) AS away_passes,
       countIf(type_name = 'Shot' AND possession_team_id=home_team_home_team_id) AS home_shots,
       countIf(type_name = 'Shot' AND possession_team_id=away_team_away_team_id) AS away_shots
FROM Python(matches_df) AS matches
JOIN Python(events_df) AS events ON events.match_id = matches.match_id
GROUP BY ALL
LIMIT 5
""", "DataFrame").iloc[0]
```

```text
home_team_home_team_name    Argentina
away_team_away_team_name     Colombia
home_score                          1
away_score                          0
home_passes                       527
away_passes                       669
home_shots                         11
away_shots                         19
Name: 0, dtype: object
```

## Populating a table from a DataFrame

We can also create and populate ClickHouse tables from DataFrames.
If we want to create a table in chDB, we need to use the Stateful Session API.

Let's import the session module:

```python
from chdb import session as chs
```

Initialize a session:

```
sess = chs.Session()
```

Next, we'll create a database:

```python
sess.query("CREATE DATABASE statsbomb")
```

Then, create an `events` table based on `events_df`:

```python
sess.query("""
CREATE TABLE statsbomb.events ORDER BY id AS
SELECT * 
FROM Python(events_df)
""")
```

We can then run the query that returns the top pass recipient:

```python
sess.query("""
SELECT pass_recipient_name, count()
FROM statsbomb.events
WHERE type_name = 'Pass' AND pass_recipient_name <> ''
GROUP BY ALL
ORDER BY count() DESC
LIMIT 10
""", "DataFrame")
```

```text
               pass_recipient_name  count()
0            Davinson Sánchez Mina       76
1  Ángel Fabián Di María Hernández       64
2              Alexis Mac Allister       62
3                   Enzo Fernandez       57
4      James David Rodríguez Rubio       56
5      Johan Andrés Mojica Palacio       55
6           Rodrigo Javier De Paul       54
7     Jefferson Andrés Lerma Solís       53
8        Jhon Adolfo Arias Andrade       52
9  Carlos Eccehomo Cuesta Figueroa       50
```

## Joining a Pandas DataFrame and table

Finally, we can also update our join query to join the `matches_df` DataFrame with the `statsbomb.events` table:

```python
sess.query("""
SELECT home_team_home_team_name, away_team_away_team_name, home_score, away_score,
       countIf(type_name = 'Pass' AND possession_team_id=home_team_home_team_id) AS home_passes,
       countIf(type_name = 'Pass' AND possession_team_id=away_team_away_team_id) AS away_passes,
       countIf(type_name = 'Shot' AND possession_team_id=home_team_home_team_id) AS home_shots,
       countIf(type_name = 'Shot' AND possession_team_id=away_team_away_team_id) AS away_shots
FROM Python(matches_df) AS matches
JOIN statsbomb.events AS events ON events.match_id = matches.match_id
GROUP BY ALL
LIMIT 5
""", "DataFrame").iloc[0]
```

```text
