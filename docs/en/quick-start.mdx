# Quick Start

ClickHouse can run on any Linux, FreeBSD, or Mac OS X with x86_64, AArch64, or PowerPC64LE CPU architecture. Follow these steps
to get up and running with ClickHouse.

:::note
If your OS is not supported or for other install options, view the [installation details in the technical reference guide](/en/getting-started/install/).
:::

##  1. Start ClickHouse

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

1. The simplest way to download ClickHouse locally is to run the following command. If your operating system is supported, an appropriate ClickHouse binary will be downloaded and made executable:
    ```bash
    curl https://clickhouse.com/ | sh
    ```

2. Run the `install` command, which defines a collection of useful symlinks along with the files and folders used by ClickHouse - all of which you can see in the output of the install script:
    ```bash
    sudo ./clickhouse install
    ```

3. At the end of the install script, you are prompted for a password for the `default` user. Feel free to enter a password, or you can optionally leave it blank:
    ```response
    Creating log directory /var/log/clickhouse-server.
    Creating data directory /var/lib/clickhouse.
    Creating pid directory /var/run/clickhouse-server.
     chown -R clickhouse:clickhouse '/var/log/clickhouse-server'
     chown -R clickhouse:clickhouse '/var/run/clickhouse-server'
     chown  clickhouse:clickhouse '/var/lib/clickhouse'
    Enter password for default user:
    ```

    You should see the following output:
    ```response
    ClickHouse has been successfully installed.

    Start clickhouse-server with:
     sudo clickhouse start

    Start clickhouse-client with:
     clickhouse-client
    ```

4. Run the following command to start the ClickHouse server:
    ```bash
    sudo clickhouse start
    ```

<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

1. The simplest way to download ClickHouse locally is to run the following command. If your operating system is supported, an appropriate ClickHouse binary will be downloaded and made executable:
    ```bash
    curl https://clickhouse.com/ | sh
    ```

2. Run the following command to start the ClickHouse server. A user named `default` with no password is created on the initial startup:
    ```bash
    ./clickhouse server
    ```

    :::info Important
    The examples throughout the documentation use the Linux commands for running the ClickHouse client (`clickhouse-client`).

    To run the ClickHouse server and client on a Mac, use `./clickhouse server` and `./clickhouse client`, respectively.

## 2. Connect to ClickHouse

You can connect to ClickHouse by using the built-in UI or the ClickHouse client.

### Use the Built-in UI

1. The ClickHouse server listens for HTTP clients on port 8123 by default. There is a built-in UI for running SQL queries at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8123/play" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8123/play</a> (change the hostname accordingly).

    <img src={require('./images/quickstart_01.png').default} class="image" alt="The Play UI" />

2. Notice in your Play UI that the username was populated with **default** and the password text field was left empty. If you assigned a password to the `default` user, enter it into the password field.

3. Try running a query. For example, the following returns the names of the predefined databases:
    ```sql
    SHOW databases
    ```

4. Click the **RUN** button and the response is displayed in the lower portion of the Play UI:

    <img src={require('./images/quickstart_02.png').default} class="image" alt="View the results" />


### Use the ClickHouse Client

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>

1. You can also connect to your ClickHouse server using a command-line tool named **clickhouse-client**:
    ```bash
    clickhouse-client
    ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

1. You can also connect to your ClickHouse server using a command-line tool named **clickhouse-client**. Open a new terminal and change directories to where you downloaded the `clickhouse` binary in step 1 above, then run the following command:
    ```bash
    ./clickhouse client
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

2. If you get the smiley face prompt, you are ready to run queries!
    ```response
    :)
    ```

    Give it a try by running the following query:
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM helloworld.my_first_table
    ORDER BY timestamp
    ```

    Notice the response comes back in a nice table format:
    ```response
    SELECT *
    FROM helloworld.my_first_table
    ORDER BY timestamp ASC

    Query id: f7a33012-bc8c-4f0f-9641-260ee1ffe4b8

    ┌─user_id─┬─message────────────────────────────────────────────┬───────────timestamp─┬──metric─┐
    │     102 │ Insert a lot of rows per batch                     │ 2022-03-21 00:00:00 │ 1.41421 │
    │     102 │ Sort your data based on your commonly-used queries │ 2022-03-22 00:00:00 │   2.718 │
    │     101 │ Hello, ClickHouse!                                 │ 2022-03-22 14:04:09 │      -1 │
    │     101 │ Granules are the smallest chunks of data read      │ 2022-03-22 14:04:14 │ 3.14159 │
    └─────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴─────────┘

    4 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.008 sec.
    ```

3. Add a `FORMAT` clause to specify one of the [many supported output formats of ClickHouse](/en/interfaces/formats/):
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM helloworld.my_first_table
    ORDER BY timestamp
    FORMAT TabSeparated
    ```
    In the above query, the output is returned as tab-separated:
    ```response
    Query id: 3604df1c-acfd-4117-9c56-f86c69721121

    102	Insert a lot of rows per batch	2022-03-21 00:00:00	1.41421
    102	Sort your data based on your commonly-used queries	2022-03-22 00:00:00	2.718
    101	Hello, ClickHouse!	2022-03-22 14:04:09	-1
    101	Granules are the smallest chunks of data read	2022-03-22 14:04:14	3.14159

    4 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.005 sec.
    ```

4. To exit the `clickhouse-client`, enter the **exit** command:
    ```bash
    :) exit
    Bye.
    ```

## 3. Create a Table

1. As in most databases management systems, ClickHouse logically groups tables into **databases**. Use the `CREATE DATABASE` command to create a new database in ClickHouse:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS helloworld
    ```

2. Even the simplest of tables in ClickHouse must specify a **table engine**. The engine determines details about the table like:
    - how and where the data is stored,
    - which queries are supported, and
    - whether or not the data is replicated.

    There are many engines to choose from, but for a simple table on a single-node ClickHouse server,
    [MergeTree](/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree.md) is your likely choice. Run the following command to create a table named `my_first_table` in the `helloworld` database:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE helloworld.my_first_table
    (
        user_id UInt32,
        message String,
        timestamp DateTime,
        metric Float32
    )
    ENGINE = MergeTree()
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, timestamp)
    ```

### A Brief Intro to Primary Keys

Before you go any further, it is important to understand how primary keys work in ClickHouse (the implementation
of primary keys might seem unexpected!):

- primary keys in ClickHouse are **_not unique_** for each row in a table

The primary key of a ClickHouse table determines how the data is sorted when written to disk. Every 8,192 rows or 10MB of
data (referred to as the **index granularity**) creates an entry in the primary key index file. This granularity concept
creates a **sparse index** that can easily fit in memory, and the granules represent a stripe of the smallest amount of
column data that gets processed during `SELECT` queries.

The primary key can be defined using the `PRIMARY KEY` command. If you define a table without a `PRIMARY KEY` specified,
then the key becomes the tuple specified in the `ORDER BY` clause. If you specify both a `PRIMARY KEY ` and an `ORDER BY`, the primary key must be a subset of the sort order.

In the example above, `my_first_table` is a MergeTree table with four columns:

- `user_id`:  a 32-bit unsigned integer
- `message`: a String data type, which replaces types like VARCHAR, BLOB, CLOB and others from other database systems
- `timestamp`: a DateTime value, which represents an instant in time
- `metric`: a 32-bit floating point number

The primary key is also the sorting key, which is a tuple of `(user_id, timestamp)`.  Therefore, the data stored in each
column file will be sorted by `user_id`, then `timestamp`.

## 4. Insert Data

You can use the familiar `INSERT INTO TABLE` command with ClickHouse, but it is important to understand that each insert into a `MergeTree` table causes a **part** to be created in storage.

The best practice with ClickHouse is to insert a large number of rows per batch - tens of thousands or even millions of
rows at once. (Don't worry - ClickHouse can easily handle that type of volume!)

1. Even for a simple example, let's insert more than one row at a time:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO helloworld.my_first_table (user_id, message, timestamp, metric) VALUES
        (101, 'Hello, ClickHouse!',                                 now(),       -1.0    ),
        (102, 'Insert a lot of rows per batch',                     yesterday(), 1.41421 ),
        (102, 'Sort your data based on your commonly-used queries', today(),     2.718   ),
        (101, 'Granules are the smallest chunks of data read',      now() + 5,   3.14159 )
    ```

    :::note
    Notice the `timestamp` column is populated using various **Date** and **DateTime** functions. ClickHouse has hundreds of useful
    functions that you can [view in the **Functions** section](/en/sql-reference/functions/).
    :::

2. Let's verify it worked:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM helloworld.my_first_table
    ```
    You should see the four rows of data that were inserted:
    <img src={require('./images/quickstart_03.png').default} class="image" alt="New rows inserted" />




## 5. Insert a CSV file

A common task when getting started with a database is to insert some data that you already have in files. We have some
sample data online that you can insert that represents clickstream data - it includes a user ID, a URL that was visited, and
the timestamp of the event.

1. Suppose we have the following text in a CSV file named `data.csv`:
    ```
    102,This is data in a file,2022-02-22 10:43:28,123.45
    101,It is comma-separated,2022-02-23 00:00:00,456.78
    103,Use FORMAT to specify the format,2022-02-21 10:43:30,678.90
    ```

2. The following command inserts the data into `my_first_table`:
    ``` bash
    clickhouse-client --query='INSERT INTO helloworld.my_first_table FORMAT CSV' < data.csv
    ```

3. Run the following query to validate the insertion:

   ```sql
   SELECT *
                         FROM helloworld.my_first_table
                         ORDER BY timestamp ASC
   ```

   ```
   SELECT *
   FROM helloworld.my_first_table
   ORDER BY timestamp ASC

   Query id: d7216864-2b85-4ad2-9073-6c0bef7ed0c6
