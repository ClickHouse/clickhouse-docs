# Performance and Optimizations

This section contains tips and best practices for improving performance with ClickHouse. 
We recommend users read [Core Concepts](/docs/en/parts) as a precursor to this section, 
which covers the main concepts required to improve performance, 
especially [Primary Indices](/docs/en/optimize/sparse-primary-indexes).
