Mutations refers to [ALTER](/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/alter/) queries that manipulate table data through deletion or updates. Most notably they are queries like ALTER TABLE â€¦ DELETE, UPDATE, etc. Performing such queries will produce new mutated versions of the data parts. This means that such statements would trigger a rewrite of whole data parts for all data that was inserted before the mutation, translating to a large amount of write requests.

For updates, you can avoid these large amounts of write requests by using specialised table engines like [ReplacingMergeTree](/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replacingmergetree.md) or [CollapsingMergeTree](/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/collapsingmergetree.md) instead of the default MergeTree table engine.
