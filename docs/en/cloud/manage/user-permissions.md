## Managing Users

:::note
ClickHouse Cloud users, whether an **Admin** or a **Developer** user, are different from database users in the ClickHouse service.

When a new service is created, a *default* user is created. When connecting to the SQL Console, an **Admin** user inherits the *default_role* which has identical permissions to the *default* user.

To manage database users utilized by your applications, you can use the web-based SQL Console.
