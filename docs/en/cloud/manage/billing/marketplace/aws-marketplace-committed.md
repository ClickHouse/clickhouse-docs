Get started with ClickHouse Cloud on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) via a committed contract. A committed contract, also known as a a Private Offer, allows customers to commit to spending a certain amount on ClickHouse Cloud over a period of time.

## Prerequisites

- A Private Offer from ClickHouse based on specific contract terms.

## Steps to sign up

1. You should have received an email with a link to review and accept your private offer.

    style={{width: '400px'}}
/>

<br />

2. Click on the **Review Offer** link in the email. This should take you to your AWS Marketplace page with the private offer details.

3. Complete the steps to subscribe on the AWS portal and click on **Set up your account**.
Note that it is critical to redirect to ClickHouse Cloud at this point and register or sign in. Without completing this step, we will not be able to link your AWS Marketplace subscription to ClickHouse Cloud.

4. Once you redirect to ClickHouse Cloud, you can either login with an existing account, or register with a new account. This step is very important so we can bind your ClickHouse Cloud organization to the AWS Marketplace billing.

If you are a new ClickHouse Cloud user, click **Register** at the bottom of the page. You will be prompted to create a new user and verify the email. After verifying your email, you can leave the ClickHouse Cloud login page and login using the new username at the [https://clickhouse.cloud](https://clickhouse.cloud).

If you are an existing ClickHouse Cloud user, simply log in using your credentials.
