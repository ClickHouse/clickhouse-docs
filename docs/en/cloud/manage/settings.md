# Configuring Settings

To specify settings for your ClickHouse Cloud service for a specific [user](/docs/en/operations/access-rights#user-account-management) or [role](/docs/en/operations/access-rights#role-management), you must use [SQL-driven Settings Profiles](/docs/en/operations/access-rights#settings-profiles-management). Applying Settings Profiles ensures that the settings you configure persist, even when your services stop, idle, and upgrade. To learn more about Settings Profiles, please see [this page](/docs/en/operations/settings/settings-profiles.md).
 
Please note that XML-based Settings Profiles and [configuration files](/docs/en/operations/configuration-files.md) are currently not supported for ClickHouse Cloud.
 
To learn more about the settings you can specify for your ClickHouse Cloud service, please see all possible settings by category in [our docs](/docs/en/operations/settings).
