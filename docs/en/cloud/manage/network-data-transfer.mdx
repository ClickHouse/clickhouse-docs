ClickHouse Cloud meters data transferred ingress and egress. 
This includes any data in and out of ClickHouse Cloud as well as any intra-region and cross-region data transfer. 
This usage is tracked at the service level. Based on this usage, customers incur data transfer charges that are then added to their monthly bill.

ClickHouse Cloud charges for:
- Data egress from ClickHouse Cloud to the public Internet, including to other regions of other cloud providers. 
- Data egress to another region in the same cloud provider.

There are no charges for intra-region data transfer or Private Link/Private Service Connect use and data transfer. 
However, we reserve the right to implement additional data transfer pricing dimensions if we see usage patterns that impact our ability to charge users appropriately.

Data transfer charges vary by Cloud Service Provider (CSP) and region. 
Public internet egress pricing is based only on the origin region. 
Inter-region (or cross-region) pricing depends on both the origin and destination regions.

The tables below shows how data transfer charges for egress vary across public internet or cross-region by cloud provider and region.

:::note
ClickHouse Cloud meters inter-region usage in terms of tiers, Tier 1 through Tier 4, depending on the origin and destination regions. The table below shows the tier for each combination of inter-region data transfer. In the Billing usage screen on ClickHouse Cloud you will see data transfer usage broken out by tiers.
