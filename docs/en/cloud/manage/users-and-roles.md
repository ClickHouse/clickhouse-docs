# Users and Roles

:::tip
If you are working with self-managed ClickHouse please see [SQL users and roles](/docs/en/guides/sre/user-management/users-and-roles.md).
:::

This article shows the basics of defining SQL users and roles and applying those privileges and permissions to databases, tables, rows, and columns.

## Admin user

ClickHouse Cloud services have an admin user, `default`, that is created when the service is created.  The password is provided at service creation, and it can be reset by ClickHouse Cloud users that have the **Admin** role.

When you add additional SQL users for your ClickHouse Cloud service, they will need a SQL username and password.  If you want them to have administrative-level privileges, then assign the new user(s) the role `default_role`. For example, adding user `clickhouse_admin`:

```sql
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS clickhouse_admin
IDENTIFIED WITH sha256_password BY 'password';
```

```sql
GRANT default_role TO clickhouse_admin;
```
