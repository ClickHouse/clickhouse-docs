## Private Link Services

You can use [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) to provide connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, your on-premises systems, and ClickHouse Cloud without having your traffic go across the internet.  This document describes how to connect to ClickHouse Cloud using AWS PrivateLink, and how to disable access to your ClickHouse Cloud services from addresses other than AWS PrivateLink addresses using ClickHouse Cloud IP Access Lists.

![VPC network diagram](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/aws-privatelink-flow.png)

This table lists the AWS Regions where ClickHouse Cloud services can be deployed, the associated VPC service name, and Availability Zone IDs.  You will need this information to setup AWS PrivateLink to connect to ClickHouse Cloud services.
<AWSRegions/>

If you require two or more AWS Private Links within the same AWS region, then please note: In ClickHouse, we have a VPC Endpoint service at a regional level. When you setup two or more VPC Endpoints in the same VPC - from the AWS VPC perspective - you are utilizing just a single AWS Private Link. In such a situation where you need two or more AWS Private Links configured within the same region, please just create just one VPC Endpoint in your VPC, and request that ClickHouse configure the same VPC Endpoint ID for all of your ClickHouse services in the same AWS region.

For the `us-east-1` region, you can ask the ClickHouse support team to determine which VPC endpoint service you should use. Please provide your ClickHouse service hostname to ClickHouse support, and we will return the VPC Service Name. (Click on **Help** in the ClickHouse Cloud console and choose **Support** to open a case.)

:::note
AWS PrivateLink can be enabled only on ClickHouse Cloud Production services
:::

## Create service endpoint

Create a service endpoint, please use a region from the table above.

:::note
AWS PrivateLink is a regional service (as of today). You can only establish a connection within the same region.
:::

In the AWS console go to **VPC > Endpoints > Create endpoints**. Click on **Other endpoint services** and use one of the VPC Service Names from supported regions. Then click on **Verify service**.

![Endpoint settings](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/aws-privatelink-endpoint-settings.png)

:::important
Please note, AWS PrivateLink connectivity works in tandem with the ClickHouse [IP Access List](/docs/en/cloud/security/ip-access-list.md) feature.

If only traffic from your PrivateLink should be allowed, set the IP Access list to DenyAll by setting the Access List to **Specific Locations** and then removing all entries from the list.  Your Access List will then report **No traffic is currently able to access this service**, but your PrivateLink addresses will be allowed. If you do need to allow traffic from select public IP addresses (for example Grafana Cloud) then add those IP addresses to your IP Access list.
:::

## Select VPC and subnets

![Select VPC and subnets](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/aws-privatelink-select-vpc-and-subnets.png)

Optional: assign Security groups/Tags

:::note
Make sure that the ClickHouse ports 8443 and 9440 are allowed in the Security group.
:::


After creating the VPC Endpoint, please write down the VPC Endpoint ID, you will need to provide this to ClickHouse Support.

![VPC endpoint ID](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/aws-privatelink-vpc-endpoint-id.png)


## AWS CloudFormation

Please use correct subnet IDs, security groups and VPC ID.

```response

  private_dns_enabled = false
}
```

## Reach out to ClickHouse Support

Click on **Help** in the ClickHouse Cloud console and choose Support to open a case.
Please provide the VPC Endpoint ID(s) and ClickHouse service hostname(s) to ClickHouse Support.

- VPC Endpoint IDs
There may be more than one VPC Endpoint ID, you should have a list of one or more of these from the step where you created the endpoint.  This is the section of the UI where the endpoint IDs are located:

  ![VPC endpoint ID](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/aws-privatelink-vpc-endpoint-id.png)

- ClickHouse instance URLs:
The ClickHouse instance URLs can be found in the Cloud console.  Click on a service that you need the URL for and open **Connect**.  The cluster hostname will be available:

  ![Cluster URL](@site/docs/en/_snippets/images/connection-details-https.png)

Once the request is processed, the VPC Endpoint service status will change from **pendingAcceptance** to **Available**.

## Test connectivity

:::note
This step validates TCP connectivity between your VPC and ClickHouse cloud infrastructure over PrivateLink.
:::

Please get **DNS Names** from VPC Endpoint configuration:

![Get DNS names](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/aws-privatelink-get-dns-names.png)

:::note
Please use this FQDN only for connectivity testing
:::

```response

# highlight-next-line
telnet: connect to address 172.31.25.195: No route to host
Trying 172.31.3.200...
```

The error below is likely caused by a missing attached security group for the VPC endpoint that allows ClickHouse ports:
```response
telnet iyc9vhhplz.us-east-1.aws.clickhouse.cloud 9440
Trying 172.31.30.46...



telnet: connect to address 172.31.30.46: Connection timed out
```

## Shift network traffic to VPC Endpoint
:::note
This step switches network traffic from traveliing over the Internet to using the VPC Endpoint.
:::

Before this step:
```response
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-29-231 ~]$ nslookup HOSTNAME.clickhouse.cloud
Server:         172.31.0.2
Address:        172.31.0.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:

# highlight-next-line
Address: 35.82.252.60
Name:   HOSTNAME.clickhouse.cloud
# highlight-next-line
Address: 35.85.205.122
```

```response
After completion of this step:
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-29-231 ~]$ nslookup HOSTNAME.clickhouse.cloud
Server:         172.31.0.2
Address:        172.31.0.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:

## Verification

:::note
IP address ranges may vary.
:::

:::important
Please make sure ClickHouse instance FQDN is pointed to the internal IP address of your VPC, otherwise connectivity will be established using the Internet. Please find these IP addresses on “Subnets” tab of VPC Endpoint configuration.
:::

![Subnets tab](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/aws-privatelink-subnets-tab.png)

Verify that instance FQDN is pointed to VPC Endpoint ID IP addresses.

```bash
nslookup HOSTNAME.clickhouse.cloud
```
```response
Server:         172.31.0.2
Address:        172.31.0.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   HOSTNAME.clickhouse.cloud
Address: 172.31.25.195
Name:   HOSTNAME.clickhouse.cloud
Address: 172.31.40.109
Name:   HOSTNAME.clickhouse.cloud
Address: 172.31.3.200
```

### Verify connectivity to ClickHouse Cloud service

```bash
curl https://HOSTNAME.clickhouse.cloud:8443
```
```response
Ok.
```

```bash
clickhouse-client --host HOSTNAME.clickhouse.cloud \
  --secure --port 9440 \
  --password PASSWORD
```
```response

## Connecting to RDS
 
AWS PrivateLink does not currently work for connecting to private RDS instances using the [PostgreSQL table engine](/en/engines/table-engines/integrations/postgresql) and the [MySQL table engine](/en/engines/table-engines/integrations/mysql).

To use the above table engines, your RDS instances must be publicly accessible and must whitelist ClickHouse Cloud’s external IP addresses. Please see our [Static IPs](/en/manage/security/cloud-endpoints-api) page for more information on our external IP addresses, and this [AWS guide](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/aurora-private-public-endpoints) on how to make your RDS instances publicly available.

:::note
Development and Production services cannot support VPC Peering because of ClickHouse Cloud’s multi-tenant architecture and lack of separate VPC per tenant.
