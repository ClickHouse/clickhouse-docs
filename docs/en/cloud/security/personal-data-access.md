## Intro
If you are a registered user, ClickHouse enables you to view and correct your account personal data, which includes your contact information and, depending on your role, may include the contact information of other users in your organization, details of API keys and other information, on a self-serve basis directly from the ClickHouse user interface (UI).

**What is a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR)**
Depending on where you are located, applicable law may also provide you additional rights as to personal data that ClickHouse holds about you (Data Subject Rights), as described in the ClickHouse Privacy Policy.  The process for exercising Data Subject Rights is known as a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR).

**Scope of Personal Data**
Please review ClickHouse’s Privacy Policy for details on personal data that ClickHouse collects and how it may be used.
