## Private Service Connect

Private Service Connect (PSC) is a Google Cloud networking feature that allows consumers to access managed services privately inside their virtual private cloud (VPC) network. Similarly, it allows managed service producers to host these services in their own separate VPC networks and offer a private connection to their consumers.

Service producers publish their applications to consumers by creating Private Service Connect services. Service consumers access those Private Service Connect services directly through one of these Private Service Connect types.

![Overview of PSC](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/gcp-psc-overview.png)

:::important
By default, a ClickHouse service is not available over a Private Service connection even if the PSC connection is approved and established; you need explicitly add the PSC ID to the allow list on an instance level by completing [step](#add-endpoint-id-to-services-allow-list) below.
:::

:::note
GCP Private Service Connect can be enabled only on ClickHouse Cloud Production services
:::

Cross-region connectivity is not supported. Producer and consumer regions should be the same. You will be able to connect from other regions within your VPC if you enable Global access on the PSC level (see below).

The process is split into four steps:

1. Obtain GCP service attachment for Private Service Connect.
1. Create a service endpoint.
1. Add Endpoint ID to ClickHouse Cloud organization.
1. Add Endpoint ID to service(s) allow list.


Find complete Terraform example for GCP Private Service Connect [here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/terraform-provider-clickhouse/tree/main/examples/PrivateServiceConnect).

## Obtain GCP service attachment for Private Service Connect

Before you get started, you'll need an API key. You can [create a new key](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/cloud/manage/openapi) or use an existing one.

### Option 1: ClickHouse Cloud console

In the ClickHouse Cloud console, open the service that you would like to connect via Private Service Connect, then open the **Settings** menu. Click on the **Set up private endpoint** button. Copy the **Service name** which will be used for setting up Private Service Connect.


![Private Endpoints](./images/gcp-privatelink-pe-create.png)

### Option 2: API 

Set environment variables before running any commands:

```bash
REGION=<region code, use GCP format>
PROVIDER=gcp
KEY_ID=<Key ID>
KEY_SECRET=<Key secret>
ORG_ID=<set ClickHouse organization ID>
```

:::note
You need at least one instance deployed in the region to perform this step.
:::

Get an instance ID from your region.

```bash
curl --silent --user ${KEY_ID:?}:${KEY_SECRET:?} https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/${ORG_ID:?}/services | jq ".result[] | select (.region==\"${REGION:?}\" and .provider==\"${PROVIDER:?}\") | .id " -r | head -1 | tee instance_id
```

Create an `INSTANCE_ID` environment variable using the ID you received in the previous step:

```bash
INSTANCE_ID=$(cat instance_id)
```

Obtain GCP service attachment for Private Service Connect:

```bash
curl --silent --user ${KEY_ID:?}:${KEY_SECRET:?} https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/${ORG_ID:?}/services/${INSTANCE_ID:?}/privateEndpointConfig | jq  .result 
{
  "endpointServiceId": "projects/.../regions/xxx/serviceAttachments/...-xxx-clickhouse-cloud",
...
}
```

Make a note of the `endpointServiceId`. You'll use it in the next step.

## Create service endpoint

In this section, we're going to create a service endpoint.

### Adding a Private Service Connection (PSC)

First up, we're going to create a PSC.

#### Option 1: Using Google Cloud console

In the Google Cloud console, navigate to **Network services -> Private Service Connect**.

![Open PSC](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/gcp-psc-open.png)

Open the Private Service Connect creation dialog by clicking on the **Connect Endpoint** button.

- **Target**: use **Published service**
- **Target service**: use **endpointServiceId** from [Obtain GCP service attachment for Private Service Connect](#obtain-gcp-service-attachment-for-private-service-connect) step.
- **Endpoint name**: set a name for the PSC **Endpoint name**.
- **Network/Subnetwork/IP address**: choose the network you want to use for the connection. You will need to create an IP address or use an existing one for the Private Service Connect endpoint.
- To make the endpoint available from any region, you can enable the **Enable global access** checkbox.

![Enable Global Access](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/gcp-psc-enable-global-access.png)

To create the PSC Endpoint, use the **ADD ENDPOINT** button.

The **Status** column will change from **Pending** to **Accepted** once the connection is approved.

![Accepted](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/gcp-psc-copy-connection-id.png)

Copy **PSC Connection ID** & **IP address**(10.142.0.2 in this example), you will need this information in the next steps.

#### Option 2: Using Terraform

```json
provider "google" {
  # Specify your project here.
  project = "my-gcp-project"
  region  = "us-central1"
}

variable "region" {
  type    = string
  default = "asia-southeast1"
}

variable "subnetwork" {
  type = string
  # Use the correct link to your subnetwork.
  # Example: "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-gcp-project/regions/asia-southeast1/subnetworks/default"
}

variable "network" {
  type = string
  # Use the correct link to your network.
  # Example: "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-gcp-project/global/networks/default"
}

resource "google_compute_address" "psc_endpoint_ip" {
  #  You can specify an IP address if needed.
  #  address      = "10.148.0.2"
  address_type = "INTERNAL"
  name         = "clickhouse-cloud-psc-${var.region}"
  purpose      = "GCE_ENDPOINT"
  region       = var.region
  subnetwork   = var.subnetwork
}

resource "google_compute_forwarding_rule" "clickhouse_cloud_psc" {
  ip_address            = google_compute_address.psc_endpoint_ip.self_link
  name                  = "ch-cloud-${var.region}"
  network               = var.network
  region                = var.region
  load_balancing_scheme = ""
  # service attachment
  target = "https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/<data from 'Obtain GCP service attachment for Private Service Connect' step>"
}

output "psc_connection_id" {
  value       = google_compute_forwarding_rule.clickhouse_cloud_psc.psc_connection_id
  description = "Add GCP PSC Connection ID to allow list on instance level."
}
```

## Setting up DNS

Two options are presented, using the Google Cloud console and using the `gcloud` CLI.

### Option 1: Using the Google Cloud console

- Create a Private DNS zone from **Supported regions**.
- Open **Network services -> Cloud DNS**.
- Select **Create Zone**:

![Create Zone](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/gcp-psc-create-zone.png)

In the Zone Type dialog, set:

- Zone type: **Private**
- Zone name: input an appropriate zone name.
- DNS name: use the **Private DNS domain** column from the **Supported regions** table for your region.
- Networks: attach a DNS zone to networks you are planning to use for connections to ClickHouse Cloud using PSC.

![Zone Type](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/gcp-psc-zone-type.png)

#### Create a wildcard record

Point it to the IP address created in the **Adding PSC Connection** step.

![Wildcard DNS](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/gcp-psc-wildcard-dns.png)

### Option 2: Using the `gcloud` CLI

#### Create DNS zone

```bash
gcloud dns \
  --project=_PROJECTID_ \
  managed-zones create ch-cloud-us-central1 \
  --description="Private DNS zone for PSC" \
  --dns-name="us-central1.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud." \
  --visibility="private" \
  --networks="https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/_PROJECTID_/global/networks/default"
```

#### Create wildcard DNS record

```bash
gcloud dns \
  --project=_PROJECTID_ \
  record-sets create *.us-central1.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud. \
  --zone="ch-cloud-us-central1" \
  --type="A" \
  --ttl="300" \
  --rrdatas="10.128.0.2"
```

### Option 3: Using Terraform

```json
resource "google_dns_managed_zone" "clickhouse_cloud_private_service_connect" {
  description   = "Private DNS zone for accessing ClickHouse Cloud using Private Service Connect"
  dns_name      = "${var.region}.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud."
  force_destroy = false
  name          = "clickhouse-cloud-private-service-connect-${var.region}"
  visibility    = "private"
}

resource "google_dns_record_set" "psc-wildcard" {
  managed_zone = google_dns_managed_zone.clickhouse_cloud_private_service_connect.name
  name         = "*.${var.region}.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud."
  type         = "A"
  rrdatas      = [google_compute_address.psc_endpoint_ip.address]
}
```

## Verify DNS setup

Any record within the us-central1.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud domain should be pointed to the Private Service Connect Endpoint IP. (10.142.0.2 in this example). 

```bash
ping instance-id.us-central1.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud.
```

```response
PING instance-id.us-east1.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud (10.142.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
```

## Add Endpoint ID to ClickHouse Cloud organization

### Option 1: ClickHouse Cloud console

To add an endpoint to your organization, proceed to the [Add Endpoint ID to service(s) allow list](#add-endpoint-id-to-services-allow-list) step. Adding the `PSC Connection ID` using the ClickHouse Cloud console to services allow list automatically adds it to organization.

To remove an endpoint, open **Organization details -> Private Endpoints** and click the delete button to remove the endpoint.

![endpoints](./images/gcp-pe-remove-private-endpoint.png)


### Option 2: API

Set the following environment variables before running any commands:

```bash
PROVIDER=gcp
KEY_ID=<Key ID>
KEY_SECRET=<Key secret>
ORG_ID=<set ClickHouse organization ID>
ENDPOINT_ID=<PSC Connection ID from the previous step>
REGION=<region code, use GCP format>
```

Set the `VPC_ENDPOINT` environment variable using data from the previous step.

To add an endpoint, run:

```bash
cat <<EOF | tee pl_config_org.json
{
  "privateEndpoints": {
    "add": [
      {
        "cloudProvider": "gcp",
        "id": "${ENDPOINT_ID:?}",
        "description": "A GCP private endpoint",
        "region": "${REGION:?}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

To remove an endpoint, run:

```bash
cat <<EOF | tee pl_config_org.json
{
  "privateEndpoints": {
    "remove": [
      {
        "cloudProvider": "gcp",
        "id": "${ENDPOINT_ID:?}",
        "region": "${REGION:?}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

Add/remove Private Endpoint to an organization:

```bash
curl --silent --user ${KEY_ID:?}:${KEY_SECRET:?} -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/${ORG_ID:?} -d @pl_config_org.json
```

## Add Endpoint ID to service(s) allow list

You need to add an Endpoint ID to the allow-list for each instance that should be available using Private Service Connect.

:::note
This step cannot be done for Development services.
:::


### Option 1: ClickHouse Cloud console

In the ClickHouse Cloud console, open the service that you would like to connect via Private Service Connect, then navigate to **Settings**. Enter the `Endpoint ID` obtained from the [previous](#create-service-endpoint) step.

:::note
If you want to allow access from an existing Private Service Connect connection, use the existing endpoint drop-down menu.
:::

![Private Endpoints](./images/gcp-privatelink-pe-filters.png)


### Option 2: API

Set these envorinment variables before running any commands:

```bash
PROVIDER=gcp
KEY_ID=<Key ID>
KEY_SECRET=<Key secret>
ORG_ID=<set ClickHouse organization ID>
ENDPOINT_ID=<PSC Connection ID from the previous step>
INSTANCE_ID=<Instance ID>
```

Execute it for each service that should be available using Private Service Connect. 

To add:

```bash
cat <<EOF | tee pl_config.json
{
  "privateEndpointIds": {
    "add": [
      "${ENDPOINT_ID}"
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

To remove:

```bash
cat <<EOF | tee pl_config.json
{
  "privateEndpointIds": {
    "remove": [
      "${ENDPOINT_ID}"
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

```bash
curl --silent --user ${KEY_ID:?}:${KEY_SECRET:?} -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/${ORG_ID:?}/services/${INSTANCE_ID:?} -d @pl_config.json | jq
```

## Accessing instance using Private Service Connect

Each instance with configured Private Service Connect filters has two endpoints: public and private. In order to connect using Private Service Connect, you need to use a private endpoint(`privateDnsHostname`).

:::note
private DNS hostname is only available from your GCP VPC. Do not try to resolve the DNS host from a machine that resides outside of GCP VPC.
:::

### Getting Private DNS Hostname

#### Option 1: ClickHouse Cloud console

In the ClickHouse Cloud console, navigate to **Settings**. Click on the **Set up private endpoint** button. In the opened flyout, copy the **DNS Name**.

![Private Endpoints](./images/gcp-privatelink-pe-dns.png)


#### Option 2: API

Set the following environment variables before running any commands:

```bash
KEY_ID=<Key ID>
KEY_SECRET=<Key secret>
ORG_ID=<set ClickHouse organization ID>
INSTANCE_ID=<Instance ID>
```

```bash
curl --silent --user $KEY_ID:$KEY_SECRET https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/$ORG_ID/services/$INSTANCE_ID/privateEndpointConfig | jq  .result 
```

```response
{
  ...
  "privateDnsHostname": "xxxxxxx.<region code>.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud"
}
```

In this example, connection to the `xxxxxxx.yy-xxxxN.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud` hostname will be routed to Private Service Connect. Meanwhile, `xxxxxxx.yy-xxxxN.gcp.clickhouse.cloud` will be routed over the internet.

## Troubleshooting

### Test DNS setup

All DNS records from the `${region}.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud.` zone should be pointed to the internal IP address from **Adding PSC Connection** step. In this example, the region is us-central1.

```bash
nslookup abcd.us-central1.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud.
```

```response
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	abcd.us-central1.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud
Address: 10.142.0.2
```

### Connection reset by peer

- Most likely, the Endpoint ID was not added to the service allow-list. Revisit the [_Add endpoint ID to services allow-list_ step](#add-endpoint-id-to-services-allow-list).

### Test connectivity

If you have problems with connecting using PSC link, check your connectivity using `openssl`. Make sure the Private Service Connect endpoint status is `Accepted`:

OpenSSL should be able to connect (see CONNECTED in the output). `errno=104` is expected.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect abcd.us-central1.p.gcp.clickhouse.cloud:9440
```

```response
# highlight-next-line
CONNECTED(00000003)
write:errno=104
---

---
New, (NONE), Cipher is (NONE)
Secure Renegotiation IS NOT supported
Compression: NONE

```

### Checking Endpoint filters

#### REST API

Set the following environment variables before running any commands:

```bash
KEY_ID=<Key ID>
KEY_SECRET=<Key secret>
ORG_ID=<please set ClickHouse organization ID>
INSTANCE_ID=<Instance ID>
```

```bash
curl --silent --user ${KEY_ID:?}:${KEY_SECRET:?} -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/${ORG_ID:?}/services/${INSTANCE_ID:?} | jq .result.privateEndpointIds
[]
```

### Connecting to a remote database 

Let's say you are trying to use the [MySQL](../../sql-reference/table-functions/mysql.md) or [PostgreSQL](../../sql-reference/table-functions/postgresql.md) table functions in ClickHouse Cloud and connect to your database hosted in GCP. GCP PSC cannot be used to enable this connection securely. PSC is a one-way, unidirectional connection. It allows your internal network or GCP VPC to connect securely to ClickHouse Cloud, but it does not allow ClickHouse Cloud to connect to your internal network.

According to the [GCP Private Service Connect documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect):

> Service-oriented design: Producer services are published through load balancers that expose a single IP address to the consumer VPC network. Consumer traffic that accesses producer services is unidirectional and can only access the service IP address, rather than having access to an entire peered VPC network.

To do this, configure your GCP VPC firewall rules to allow connections from ClickHouse Cloud to your internal/private database service. Check the [default egress IP addresses for ClickHouse Cloud regions](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/manage/security/cloud-endpoints-api), along with the [available static IP addresses](https://api.clickhouse.cloud/static-ips.json).
