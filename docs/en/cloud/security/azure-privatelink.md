# Azure Private Link

:::note
Azure Private Link can be enabled only on ClickHouse Cloud **Production** services. **Development** services are not supported.
:::

This guide shows how to use Azure Private Link to provide private connectivity via a virtual network between Azure (including customer-owned and Microsoft Partner services) and ClickHouse Cloud. Azure Private Link simplifies the network architecture and secures the connection between endpoints in Azure by eliminating data exposure to the public internet.

![Overview of PrivateLink](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-pe.png)

Unlike AWS and GCP, Azure supports cross-region connectivity via Private Link. This enables you to establish connections between VNETs located in different regions where you have ClickHouse services deployed.

:::note
Additional charges may be applied to inter-region traffic. Please check latest Azure documentation.
:::

Please complete the following steps to enable Azure Private Link:

1. Obtain Azure connection alias for Private Link
1. Create a Private Endpoint in Azure
1. Add the Private Endpoint GUID to your ClickHouse Cloud organization
1. Add the Private Endpoint GUID to your service(s) allow list
1. Access your ClickHouse Cloud service using Private Link


Find complete Terraform example for Azure Private Link [here](https://github.com/ClickHouse/terraform-provider-clickhouse/tree/main/examples/PrivateLinkAzure).

## Obtain Azure connection alias for Private Link

### Option 1: ClickHouse Cloud console

In the ClickHouse Cloud console, open the service that you would like to connect via PrivateLink, then open the **Settings** menu. Click on the **Set up private endpoint** button. Copy the **Service name** which will be used for setting up Private Link.


![Private Endpoints](./images/azure-privatelink-pe-create.png)


### Option 2: API

Before you get started, you'll need a ClickHouse Cloud API key. You can [create a new key](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/cloud/manage/openapi) or use an existing one. Note that you will need an **Admin** key to manage the Private Link configuration.

Once you have your API key, set the following environment variables before running any commands:

```bash
REGION=<region code, use Azure format>
PROVIDER=azure
KEY_ID=<Key ID>
KEY_SECRET=<Key secret>
ORG_ID=<set ClickHouse organization ID>
```

Obtain an instance ID from your region:

You'll need at least one ClickHouse Cloud service deployed in the specified region to perform this step.

```bash
curl --silent --user ${KEY_ID:?}:${KEY_SECRET:?} https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/${ORG_ID:?}/services | jq ".result[] | select (.region==\"${REGION:?}\" and .provider==\"${PROVIDER:?}\") | .id " -r | head -1 | tee instance_id
```

Create an `INSTANCE_ID` environment variable using the ID you received in the previous step:

```bash
INSTANCE_ID=$(cat instance_id)
```

Obtain your Azure connection alias and Private DNS hostname for Private Link:

```bash
curl --silent --user ${KEY_ID:?}:${KEY_SECRET:?} https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/${ORG_ID:?}/services/${INSTANCE_ID:?}/privateEndpointConfig | jq  .result 
{
  "endpointServiceId": "production-westus3-0-0.63c890a9-4d32-48cc-a08c-8cd92dfb1ad3.westus3.azure.privatelinkservice",
  ...
}
```

Make a note of the `endpointServiceId`. You'll use it in the next step.

## Create a Private Endpoint in Azure {#create-private-endpoint-in-azure}

In this section, we're going to create a Private Endpoint in Azure. You can use either the Azure Portal or Terraform.

### Option 1: Using Azure Portal to create a Private Endpoint in Azure

In the Azure Portal, open **Private Link Center â†’ Private Endpoints**.

![Open Azure Private Center](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-private-link-center.png)

Open the Private Endpoint creation dialog by clicking on the **Create** button.

![Create PE](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-private-link-center.png)

---

In the following screen, specify the following options:

- **Subscription** / **Resource Group**: Please choose the Azure subscription and resource group for the Private Endpoint.
- **Name**: Set a name for the **Private Endpoint**.
- **Region**: Choose region where the deployed VNET that will be connected to ClickHouse Cloud via Private Link.

After you have completed the above steps, click the **Next: Resource** button.

![Create PE](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-pe-create-basic.png)

---

Select the option **Connect to an Azure resource by resource ID or alias**.

For the **Resource ID or alias**, use the **endpointServiceId** you have obtained from the [Obtain Azure connection alias for Private Link](#obtain-azure-connection-alias-for-private-link) step.

Click **Next: Virtual Network** button.

![PE resource](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-pe-resource.png)

---

- **Virtual network**: Choose the VNET you want to connect to ClickHouse Cloud using Private Link
- **Subnet**: Choose the subnet where Private Endpoint will be created

Optional: 

- **Application security group**: You can attach ASG to Private Endpoint and use it in Network Security Groups to filter network traffic to/from Private Endpoint.

Click **Next: DNS** button.

![PE network](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-pe-create-vnet.png)

Click the **Next: Tags** button.

---

![PE DNS](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-pe-create-dns.png)

Optionally, you can attach tags to your Private Endpoint.

Click the **Next: Review + create** button.

---

![PE tags](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-pe-create-tags.png)

Finally, click the **Create** button.

![PE review](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-pe-create-review.png)

The **Connection status** of the created Private Endpoint will be in **Pending** state. It will change to **Approved** state once you add this Private Endpoint to the service allow list.

Open the network interface associated with Private Endpoint and copy the **Private IPv4 address**(10.0.0.4 in this example), you will need this information in the next steps.

![PE IP address](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-pe-ip.png)

### Option 2: Using Terraform to create a Private Endpoint in Azurue

Use the template below to use Terrafrom to create a Private Endpoint:

```json
resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "example_clickhouse_cloud" {
  name                = var.pe_name
  location            = var.pe_location
  resource_group_name = var.pe_resource_group_name
  subnet_id           = var.pe_subnet_id

  private_service_connection {
    name                              = "test-pl"
    private_connection_resource_alias = "<data from 'Obtain Azure connection alias for Private Link' step>"
    is_manual_connection              = true
  }
}
```

### Obtaining the Private Endpoint resourceGuid {#obtaining-private-endpoint-resourceguid}

In order to use Private Link, you need to add the Private Endpoint connection GUID to your service allow list.

The Private Endpoint resource GUID is only exposed in the Azure Portal. Open the Private Endpoint created in previous step and click **JSON View**:

![PE GUID](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-pe-view.png)

Under properties, find `resourceGuid` field and copy this value:

![PE GUID](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-pe-resource-guid.png)

## Setting up DNS for Private Link

You need will need to create a Private DNS zone (`${location_code}.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud`) and attach it to your VNET to access resources via Private Link.

### Create Private DNS zone

**Option 1: Using Azure portal**

Please follow the following guide to [create an Azure private DNS zone using the Azure Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-getstarted-portal).

**Option 2: Using Terraform**

Use the following Terraform template to create a Private DNS zone:

```json
resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone" "clickhouse_cloud_private_link_zone" {
  name                = "${var.location}.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud"
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
}
```

### Create a wildcard DNS record

Create a wildcard record and point to your Private Endpoint:

**Option 1: Using Azure Portal**

1. Open the MyAzureResourceGroup resource group and select the `${region_code}.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud` private zone.
2. Select + Record set.
3. For Name, type `*`.
4. For IP Address, type the IP address you see for Private Endpoint.
5. Select **OK**.

![PE review](@site/docs/en/cloud/security/images/azure-pl-dns-wildcard.png)

**Option 2: Using Terraform**

Use the following Terraform template to create a wildcard DNS record:

```json
resource "azurerm_private_dns_a_record" "example" {
  name                = "*"
  zone_name           = var.zone_name
  resource_group_name = var.resource_group_name
  ttl                 = 300
  records             = ["10.0.0.4"]
}
```

### Create a virtual network link

To link the private DNS zone to a virtual network, you'll need create a virtual network link.

**Option 1: Using Azure Portal**

Please follow the following guide to [link the virtual network to your private DNS zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-getstarted-portal#link-the-virtual-network).

**Option 2: Using Terraform**

Use the following Terraform template to link the virtual network to your private DNS zone:

```json
resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link" "example" {
  name                  = "test"
  resource_group_name   = var.resource_group_name
  private_dns_zone_name = var.zone_name
  virtual_network_id    = var.virtual_network_id
}
```

### Verify DNS setup

Any record within the westus3.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud domain should be pointed to the Private Endpoint IP. (10.0.0.4 in this example). 

```bash
nslookup instance-id.westus3.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud.
Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	instance-id.westus3.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud
Address: 10.0.0.4
```

## Add the Private Endpoint GUID to your ClickHouse Cloud organization

### Option 1: ClickHouse Cloud console

To add an endpoint to organization, proceed to the [Add the Private Endpoint GUID to your service(s) allow list](#add-private-endpoint-guid-to-services-allow-list) step. Adding the `Private Endpoint GUID` using the ClickHouse Cloud console to the services allow list automatically adds it to organization.

To remove an endpoint, open **Organization details -> Private Endpoints** and click the delete button to remove the endpoint.

![endpoints](./images/azure-pe-remove-private-endpoint.png)


### Option 2: API

Set the following environment variables before running any commands:

```bash
PROVIDER=azure
KEY_ID=<Key ID>
KEY_SECRET=<Key secret>
ORG_ID=<set ClickHouse organization ID>
ENDPOINT_ID=<Private Endpoint resourceGuid>
REGION=<region code, use Azure format>
```

Set the `VPC_ENDPOINT` environment variable using data from the [Obtaining the Private Endpoint resourceGuid](#obtaining-private-endpoint-resourceguid) step.

Run the following command to add the Private Endpoint:

```bash
cat <<EOF | tee pl_config_org.json
{
  "privateEndpoints": {
    "add": [
      {
        "cloudProvider": "azure",
        "id": "${ENDPOINT_ID:?}",
        "description": "Azure private endpoint",
        "region": "${REGION:?}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

You can also run the following command to remove a Private Endpoint:

```bash
cat <<EOF | tee pl_config_org.json
{
  "privateEndpoints": {
    "remove": [
      {
        "cloudProvider": "azure",
        "id": "${ENDPOINT_ID:?}",
        "region": "${REGION:?}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

After adding or removing a Private Endpoint, run the following command to apply it to your organization:

```bash
curl --silent --user ${KEY_ID:?}:${KEY_SECRET:?} -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/${ORG_ID:?} -d @pl_config_org.json
```

## Add the Private Endpoint GUID to your service(s) allow list {#add-private-endpoint-guid-to-services-allow-list}

By default, a ClickHouse Cloud service is not available over a Private Link connection even if the Private Link connection is approved and established. You need to explicitly add the Private Endpoint GUID for each service that should be available using Private Link.

### Option 1: ClickHouse Cloud console

In the ClickHouse Cloud console, open the service that you would like to connect via PrivateLink then navigate to **Settings**. Enter the `Endpoint ID` obtained from the [previous](#obtaining-private-endpoint-resourceguid) step.

:::note
If you want to allow access from an existing PrivateLink connection, use the existing endpoint drop-down menu.
:::

![Private Endpoints](./images/azure-privatelink-pe-filter.png)

### Option 2: API

Set these environment variables before running any commands:

```bash
PROVIDER=azure
KEY_ID=<Key ID>
KEY_SECRET=<Key secret>
ORG_ID=<set ClickHouse organization ID>
ENDPOINT_ID=<Private Endpoint resourceGuid>
INSTANCE_ID=<Instance ID>
```

Execute it for each service that should be available using Private Link. 

Run the following command to add the Private Endpoint to the services allowlist:

```bash
cat <<EOF | tee pl_config.json
{
  "privateEndpointIds": {
    "add": [
      "${ENDPOINT_ID:?}"
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

You can also run the following command to remove a Private Endpoint from the services allow list:

```bash
cat <<EOF | tee pl_config.json
{
  "privateEndpointIds": {
    "remove": [
      "${ENDPOINT_ID:?}"
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

After adding or removing a Private Endpoint to the services allow list, run the following command to apply it to your organization:

```bash
curl --silent --user ${KEY_ID:?}:${KEY_SECRET:?} -X PATCH -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/${ORG_ID:?}/services/${INSTANCE_ID?} -d @pl_config.json | jq
```

## Access your ClickHouse Cloud service using Private Link

Each service with Private Link enabled has a public and private endpoint. In order to connect using Private Link, you need to use a private endpoint which will be `privateDnsHostname`.

:::note
Private DNS hostname is only available from your Azure VNET. Do not try to resolve the DNS host from a machine that resides outside of Azure VNET.
:::

### Obtaining the Private DNS Hostname

#### Option 1: ClickHouse Cloud console

In the ClickHouse Cloud console, navigate to **Settings**. Click on the **Set up private endpoint** button. In the opened flyout, copy the **DNS Name**.

![Private Endpoints](./images/azure-privatelink-pe-dns.png)

#### Option 2: API

Set the following environment variables before running any commands:

```bash
KEY_ID=<Key ID>
KEY_SECRET=<Key secret>
ORG_ID=<set ClickHouse organization ID>
INSTANCE_ID=<Instance ID>
```

Run the following command:

```bash
curl --silent --user ${KEY_ID:?}:${KEY_SECRET:?} https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/${ORG_ID:?}/services/${INSTANCE_ID:?}/privateEndpointConfig | jq  .result 
```

You should receive a response similar to the following:

```response
{
  ...
  "privateDnsHostname": "xxxxxxx.<region code>.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud"
}
```

In this example, connection to the `xxxxxxx.region_code.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud` hostname will be routed to Private Link. Meanwhile, `xxxxxxx.region_code.azure.clickhouse.cloud` will be routed over the internet.

Use the `privateDnsHostname` to connect to your ClickHouse Cloud service using Private Link.

## Troubleshooting

### Test DNS setup

All DNS records from the `${region_code}.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud.` zone should be pointed to the internal IP address from the [*Create a Private Endpoint in Azure*](#create-private-endpoint-in-azure) step. In this example, the region is `westus3`.

Run the following command:

```bash
nslookup abcd.westus3.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud.
```

You should receive the following response:

```response
Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	abcd.westus3.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud
Address: 10.0.0.4
```

### Connection reset by peer

Most likely, the Private Endpoint GUID was not added to the service allow-list. Revisit the [_Add Private Endpoint GUID to your services allow-list_ step](#add-private-endpoint-guid-to-services-allow-list).

### Private Endpoint is in Pending state

Most likely, the Private Endpoint GUID was not added to the service allow-list. Revisit the [_Add Private Endpoint GUID to your services allow-list_ step](#add-private-endpoint-guid-to-services-allow-list).

### Test connectivity

If you have problems with connecting using Private Link, check your connectivity using `openssl`. Make sure the Private Link endpoint status is `Accepted`.

OpenSSL should be able to connect (see CONNECTED in the output). `errno=104` is expected.

```bash
openssl s_client -connect abcd.westus3.privatelink.azure.clickhouse.cloud.cloud:9440
```

```response
# highlight-next-line
CONNECTED(00000003)
write:errno=104
---

---
New, (NONE), Cipher is (NONE)
Secure Renegotiation IS NOT supported

```

### Checking Private Endpoint filters

Set the following environment variables before running any commands:

```bash
KEY_ID=<Key ID>
KEY_SECRET=<Key secret>
ORG_ID=<please set ClickHouse organization ID>
INSTANCE_ID=<Instance ID>
```

Run the following command to check Private Endpoint filters:

```bash
curl --silent --user ${KEY_ID:?}:${KEY_SECRET:?} -X GET -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.clickhouse.cloud/v1/organizations/${ORG_ID:?}/services/${INSTANCE_ID:?} | jq .result.privateEndpointIds
[]
```
