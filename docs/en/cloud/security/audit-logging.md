The **Activity** page displays a table containing a list of events logged about your organization. By default, this list is sorted in a reverse-chronological order (most-recent event at the top). Change the order of the table by clicking on the columns headers. Each item of the table contains the following fields:


- **Activity:** A text snippet describing the event
- **User:** The user that initiated the event
- **IP Address:** When applicable, this flied lists the IP Address of the user that initiated the event
- **Time:** The timestamp of the event

You can use the search bar provided to isolate events based on some criteria like for example service name or IP address. You can also export this information in a CSV format for distribution or analysis in an external tool.
