# Column Types

See [Data Types](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/data-types/) for general reference.

## Numeric types

:::tip

Numeric types encoding matches memory layout of little endian cpus like AMD64 or ARM64.

This allows to implement very efficient encoding and decoding.

:::

### Integers

String of Int and UInt of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 or 256 bits, in little endian.

### Floats

Float32 and Float64 in IEEE 754 binary representation.

## String

Just an array of String, i.e. (len, value).

## FixedString(N)

An array of N-byte sequences.

## IP

IPv4 is alias of `UInt32` numeric type and represented as UInt32.

IPv6 is alias of `FixedString(16)` and represented as binary directly.

## Tuple

Tuple is just an array of columns. For example, Tuple(String, UInt8) is just two columns
encoded continuously.

## Map

`Map(K, V)` consists of three columns: `Offsets ColUInt64, Keys K, Values V`.

Rows count in `Keys` and `Values` column is last value from `Offsets`.

## Array

`Array(T)` consists of two columns: `Offsets ColUInt64, Data T`.

Rows count in `Data` is last value from `Offsets`.

## Nullable

`Nullable(T)` consists of `Nulls ColUInt8, Values T` with same rows count.

```go
// Nulls is nullable "mask" on Values column.
// For example, to encode [null, "", "hello", null, "world"]
//	Values: ["", "", "hello", "", "world"] (len: 5)
//	Nulls:  [ 1,  0,       0,  1,       0] (len: 5)
```

## UUID

Alias of `FixedString(16)`, UUID value represented as binary.

## Enum

Alias of `Int8` or `Int16`, but each integer is mapped to some `String` value.

## Low Cardinality

`LowCardinality(T)` consists of `Index T, Keys K`,
where `K` is one of (UInt8, UInt16, UInt32, UInt64) depending on size of `Index`.

```go
// Index (i.e. dictionary) column contains unique values, Keys column contains
// sequence of indexes in Index column that represent actual values.
//
// For example, ["Eko", "Eko", "Amadela", "Amadela", "Amadela", "Amadela"] can
// be encoded as:
//	Index: ["Eko", "Amadela"] (String)
//	Keys:  [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] (UInt8)
//
// The CardinalityKey is chosen depending on Index size, i.e. maximum value
// of chosen type should be able to represent any index of Index element.
```

## Bool

Alias of `UInt8`, where `0` is false and `1` is true.
