# Query Insights

The **Query Insights** feature makes ClickHouse's built-in query log easier to use through various visualizations and tables. ClickHouse's `system.query_log` table is a key source of information for query optimization, debugging, and monitoring overall cluster health and performance.

## Query Overview

After selecting a service, the **Monitoring** navigation item in the left sidebar should expand to reveal a new **Query insights** sub-item. Clicking on this option opens the new Query insights page:

## Top-level metrics

The stat boxes at the top represent some basic top-level query metrics over the selected period of time. Beneath it, weâ€™ve exposed three time-series charts representing query volume, latency, and error rate broken down by query kind (select, insert, other) over a selected time window. The latency chart can be further adjusted to display p50, p90, and p99 latencies:

## Recent queries

Beneath the top-level metrics, a table displays query log entries (grouped by normalized query hash and user) over the selected time window:

Recent queries can be filtered and sorted by any available field. The table can also be configured to display orhide additional fields such as tables, p90, and p99 latencies.

## Query drill-down

Selecting a query from the recent queries table will open a flyout containing metrics and information specific to the selected query:

As we can see from the flyout, this particular query has been run more than 3000 times in the last 24 hours. All metrics in the **Query info** tab are aggregated metrics, but we can also view metrics from individual runs by selecting the **Query history** tab:

  alt="Query Insights UI Query Information"
  style={{width: '400px'}} />

From this pane, the `Settings` and `Profile Events` items for each query run can be expanded to reveal additional information.
