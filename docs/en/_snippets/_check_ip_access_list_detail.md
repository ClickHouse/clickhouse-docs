From your ClickHouse Cloud services list choose the service that you will work with and switch to **Settings**.

If the IP Access List shows that **No traffic is currently able to access this service** then you can resolve the problem with **Add entry**:

For the Quick Start, if your local security policy allows it, you might add only your current IP Address.  You can do this with **Add my current IP**, which will populate the form with your current IP and the description "Home IP".  You can modify the form as you see fit and then **Add entry** and **Submit entry**.
