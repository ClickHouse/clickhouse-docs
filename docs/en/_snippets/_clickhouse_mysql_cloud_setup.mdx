1. After creating your ClickHouse Cloud Service, on the credentials screen, select the MySQL tab
![Credentials screen - Prompt](./images/mysql1.png)
2. Toggle the switch to enable the MySQL interface for this specific service. This will expose port `3306` for this service and prompt you with your MySQL connection screen that include your unique MySQL username. The password will be the same as the service's default user password.

Alternatively, in order to enable the MySQL interface for an existing service:
3. Ensure your service is in `Running` state then click on the "View connection string" button for the service you want to enable the MySQL interface for

4. Toggle the switch to enable the MySQL interface for this specific service. This will prompt you to enter the default password.

5. After entering the password, you will get prompted the MySQL connection string for this service

## Creating multiple MySQL users in ClickHouse Cloud

By default, there is a built-in `mysql4<subdomain>` user. The `<subdomain>` part is the first segment of your ClickHouse Cloud hostname. This format is necessary to work with the tools that implement secure connection, but don't provide [SNI information in their TLS handshake](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni), which makes it impossible to do the internal routing without an extra hint in the username. When not sure whether a tool supports TLS SNI, it is better to follow `mysql4<subdomain>_<username>` format, where `<subdomain>` is a hint to identify your Cloud service, and `<username>` is an arbitrary suffix of your choice; if a tool supports TLS SNI, then an arbitrary name can be used for custom MySQL users.

:::tip
For ClickHouse Cloud hostname like `foobar.us-east1.aws.clickhouse.cloud`, the `<subdomain>` part equals to `foobar`, and a custom MySQL username could look like `mysql4foobar_team1`.

You can create extra users to use with the MySQL interface if, for example, you need to apply extra settings.

1. Optional - create a [settings profile](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/settings-profile) to apply for your custom user. For example, `my_custom_profile` with an extra setting which will be applied by default when we connect with the user we create later:

    ```sql
    CREATE SETTINGS PROFILE my_custom_profile SETTINGS prefer_column_name_to_alias=1;
    ```

    `prefer_column_name_to_alias` is used just as an example, you can use other settings there.
2. [Create a user](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/user) using the following format: `mysql4<subdomain>_<username>` ([see above](#creating-multiple-mysql-users-in-clickhouse-cloud)). The password must be in double SHA1 format. For example:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER mysql4foobar_team1 IDENTIFIED WITH double_sha1_password BY 'YourPassword42$';
    ```

    or if you want to use a custom profile for this user:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER mysql4foobar_team1 IDENTIFIED WITH double_sha1_password BY 'YourPassword42$' SETTINGS PROFILE 'my_custom_profile';
    ```

    where `my_custom_profile` is the name of the profile you created earlier.
3. [Grant](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/grant) the new user the necessary permissions to interact with the desired tables or databases. For example, if you want to grant access to `system.query_log` only:

    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT ON system.query_log TO mysql4foobar_team1;
    ```

4. Use the created user to connect to your ClickHouse Cloud service with the MySQL interface.
