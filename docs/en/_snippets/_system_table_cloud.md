:::note Querying in ClickHouse Cloud
The data in this system table is held locally on each node in ClickHouse Cloud. Obtaining a complete view of all data, therefore, requires the `clusterAllReplicas` function. See [here](/docs/en/operations/system-tables#system-tables-in-clickhouse-cloud) for further details.
