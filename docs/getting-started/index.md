# Tutorials and example datasets

We have a lot of resources for helping you get started and learn how ClickHouse works:

- If you need to get ClickHouse up and running, check out our [Quick Start](/get-started/quick-start)
- The [ClickHouse Tutorial](../tutorial.md) analyzes a dataset of New York City taxi rides

In addition, the sample datasets provide a great experience on working with ClickHouse,
learning important techniques and tricks, and seeing how to take advantage of the many powerful
functions in ClickHouse. The sample datasets include:
