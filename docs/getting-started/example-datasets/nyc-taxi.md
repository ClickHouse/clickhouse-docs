import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The New York taxi data sample consists of 3+ billion taxi and for-hire vehicle (Uber, Lyft, etc.) trips originating in New York City since 2009. This getting started guide uses a 3m row sample.

The full dataset can be obtained in a couple of ways:

- insert the data directly into ClickHouse Cloud from S3 or GCS
- download prepared partitions
- Alternatively users can query the full dataset in our demo environment at [sql.clickhouse.com](https://sql.clickhouse.com/?query=U0VMRUNUIGNvdW50KCkgRlJPTSBueWNfdGF4aS50cmlwcw&chart=eyJ0eXBlIjoibGluZSIsImNvbmZpZyI6eyJ0aXRsZSI6IlRlbXBlcmF0dXJlIGJ5IGNvdW50cnkgYW5kIHllYXIiLCJ4YXhpcyI6InllYXIiLCJ5YXhpcyI6ImNvdW50KCkiLCJzZXJpZXMiOiJDQVNUKHBhc3Nlbmdlcl9jb3VudCwgJ1N0cmluZycpIn19).


:::note
The example queries below were executed on a **Production** instance of ClickHouse Cloud. For more information see
["Playground specifications"](/getting-started/playground#specifications).

## Create the table trips {#create-the-table-trips}

Start by creating a table for the taxi rides:

```sql

CREATE DATABASE nyc_taxi;

CREATE TABLE nyc_taxi.trips_small (
    trip_id             UInt32,
    pickup_datetime     DateTime,
    dropoff_datetime    DateTime,
    pickup_longitude    Nullable(Float64),
    pickup_latitude     Nullable(Float64),
    dropoff_longitude   Nullable(Float64),
    dropoff_latitude    Nullable(Float64),
    passenger_count     UInt8,
    trip_distance       Float32,
    fare_amount         Float32,
    extra               Float32,
    tip_amount          Float32,
    tolls_amount        Float32,
    total_amount        Float32,
    payment_type        Enum('CSH' = 1, 'CRE' = 2, 'NOC' = 3, 'DIS' = 4, 'UNK' = 5),
    pickup_ntaname      LowCardinality(String),
    dropoff_ntaname     LowCardinality(String)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PRIMARY KEY (pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime);
```

## Load the data directly from object storage {#load-the-data-directly-from-object-storage}

Users' can grab a small subset of the data (3 million rows) for getting familiar with it. The data is in TSV files in object storage, which is easily streamed into
ClickHouse Cloud using the `s3` table function. 

The same data is stored in both S3 and GCS; choose either tab.

<Tabs groupId="storageVendor">
<TabItem value="s3" label="S3">

The following command streams three files from an S3 bucket into the `trips_small` table (the `{0..2}` syntax is a wildcard for the values 0, 1, and 2):

```sql
INSERT INTO nyc_taxi.trips_small
SELECT
    trip_id,
    pickup_datetime,
    dropoff_datetime,
    pickup_longitude,
    pickup_latitude,
    dropoff_longitude,
    dropoff_latitude,
    passenger_count,
    trip_distance,
    fare_amount,
    extra,
    tip_amount,
    tolls_amount,
    total_amount,
    payment_type,
    pickup_ntaname,
    dropoff_ntaname
FROM s3(
    'https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/nyc-taxi/trips_{0..2}.gz',
    'TabSeparatedWithNames'
);
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="gcs" label="GCS" default>

The following command streams three files from a GCS bucket into the `trips` table (the `{0..2}` syntax is a wildcard for the values 0, 1, and 2):

```sql
INSERT INTO nyc_taxi.trips_small
SELECT
    trip_id,
    pickup_datetime,
    dropoff_datetime,
    pickup_longitude,
    pickup_latitude,
    dropoff_longitude,
    dropoff_latitude,
    passenger_count,
    trip_distance,
    fare_amount,
    extra,
    tip_amount,
    tolls_amount,
    total_amount,
    payment_type,
    pickup_ntaname,
    dropoff_ntaname
FROM gcs(
    'https://storage.googleapis.com/clickhouse-public-datasets/nyc-taxi/trips_{0..2}.gz',
    'TabSeparatedWithNames'
);
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sample queries {#sample-queries}

The following queries are executed on the sample described above. Users can run the sample queries on the full dataset in [sql.clickhouse.com](https://sql.clickhouse.com/?query=U0VMRUNUIGNvdW50KCkgRlJPTSBueWNfdGF4aS50cmlwcw&chart=eyJ0eXBlIjoibGluZSIsImNvbmZpZyI6eyJ0aXRsZSI6IlRlbXBlcmF0dXJlIGJ5IGNvdW50cnkgYW5kIHllYXIiLCJ4YXhpcyI6InllYXIiLCJ5YXhpcyI6ImNvdW50KCkiLCJzZXJpZXMiOiJDQVNUKHBhc3Nlbmdlcl9jb3VudCwgJ1N0cmluZycpIn19), modifying the queries below to use the table `nyc_taxi.trips`.

Let's see how many rows were inserted:

```sql runnable
SELECT count()
FROM nyc_taxi.trips_small;
```

Each TSV file has about 1M rows, and the three files have 3,000,317 rows. Let's look at a few rows:

```sql runnable
SELECT *
FROM nyc_taxi.trips_small
LIMIT 10;
```

Notice there are columns for the pickup and dropoff dates, geo coordinates, fare details, New York neighborhoods, and more.


Let's run a few queries. This query shows us the top 10 neighborhoods that have the most frequent pickups:

```sql runnable
SELECT
   pickup_ntaname,
   count(*) AS count
FROM nyc_taxi.trips_small WHERE pickup_ntaname != ''
GROUP BY pickup_ntaname
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query shows the average fare based on the number of passengers:

```sql runnable view='chart' chart_config='eyJ0eXBlIjoiYmFyIiwiY29uZmlnIjp7InhheGlzIjoicGFzc2VuZ2VyX2NvdW50IiwieWF4aXMiOiJhdmcodG90YWxfYW1vdW50KSIsInRpdGxlIjoiQXZlcmFnZSBmYXJlIGJ5IHBhc3NlbmdlciBjb3VudCJ9fQ'
SELECT
   passenger_count,
   avg(total_amount)
FROM nyc_taxi.trips_small
WHERE passenger_count < 10
GROUP BY passenger_count;
```

Here's a correlation between the number of passengers and the distance of the trip:

```sql runnable chart_config='eyJ0eXBlIjoiaG9yaXpvbnRhbCBiYXIiLCJjb25maWciOnsieGF4aXMiOiJwYXNzZW5nZXJfY291bnQiLCJ5YXhpcyI6ImRpc3RhbmNlIiwic2VyaWVzIjoiY291bnRyeSIsInRpdGxlIjoiQXZnIGZhcmUgYnkgcGFzc2VuZ2VyIGNvdW50In19'
SELECT
    passenger_count,
    avg(trip_distance) AS distance,
    count() AS c
FROM nyc_taxi.trips_small
GROUP BY passenger_count
ORDER BY passenger_count ASC
```

## Download of prepared partitions {#download-of-prepared-partitions}

:::note
The following steps provide information about the original dataset, and a method for loading prepared partitions into a self-managed ClickHouse server environment.
:::

See https://github.com/toddwschneider/nyc-taxi-data and http://tech.marksblogg.com/billion-nyc-taxi-rides-redshift.html for the description of a dataset and instructions for downloading.

Downloading will result in about 227 GB of uncompressed data in CSV files. The download takes about an hour over a 1 Gbit connection (parallel downloading from s3.amazonaws.com recovers at least half of a 1 Gbit channel).
Some of the files might not download fully. Check the file sizes and re-download any that seem doubtful.

```bash
$ curl -O https://datasets.clickhouse.com/trips_mergetree/partitions/trips_mergetree.tar
# Validate the checksum
$ md5sum trips_mergetree.tar
# Checksum should be equal to: f3b8d469b41d9a82da064ded7245d12c
$ tar xvf trips_mergetree.tar -C /var/lib/clickhouse # path to ClickHouse data directory
$ # check permissions of unpacked data, fix if required
$ sudo service clickhouse-server restart
$ clickhouse-client --query "select count(*) from datasets.trips_mergetree"
```

:::info
If you will run the queries described below, you have to use the full table name, `datasets.trips_mergetree`.

The following server was used:

Two Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v2 @ 2.60GHz, 16 physical cores total, 128 GiB RAM, 8x6 TB HD on hardware RAID-5

Execution time is the best of three runs. But starting from the second run, queries read data from the file system cache. No further caching occurs: the data is read out and processed in each run.

Creating a table on three servers:

On each server:

```

On the source server:

```sql
CREATE TABLE trips_mergetree_x3 AS trips_mergetree_third ENGINE = Distributed(perftest, default, trips_mergetree_third, rand());
```

The following query redistributes data:

```sql
INSERT INTO trips_mergetree_x3 SELECT * FROM trips_mergetree;
```

This takes 2454 seconds.

On three servers:

Q1: 0.212 seconds.
Q2: 0.438 seconds.
Q3: 0.733 seconds.
Q4: 1.241 seconds.

No surprises here, since the queries are scaled linearly.

We also have the results from a cluster of 140 servers:

Q1: 0.028 sec.
Q2: 0.043 sec.
Q3: 0.051 sec.
Q4: 0.072 sec.

In this case, the query processing time is determined above all by network latency.
We ran queries using a client located in a different datacenter than where the cluster was located, which added about 20 ms of latency.
