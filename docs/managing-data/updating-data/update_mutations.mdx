Update mutations refers to `ALTER` queries that manipulate table data through updates. Most notably they are queries like `ALTER TABLE UPDATE`, etc. Performing such queries will produce new mutated versions of the data ^^parts^^. This means that such statements would trigger a rewrite of whole data ^^parts^^ for all data that was inserted before the ^^mutation^^, translating to a large amount of write requests.

:::info
For updates, you can avoid these large amounts of write requests by using specialised table engines like [ReplacingMergeTree](/guides/replacing-merge-tree) or [CollapsingMergeTree](/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/collapsingmergetree) instead of the default ^^MergeTree^^ ^^table engine^^.
