## Background {#background}

Partitioning is specified on a table when it is initially defined via the `PARTITION BY` clause. This clause can contain a SQL expression on any columns, the results of which will define which partition a row is sent to.

The data ^^parts^^ are logically associated with each partition on disk and can be queried in isolation. For the example below, we partition the `posts` table by year using the expression `toYear(CreationDate)`. As rows are inserted into ClickHouse, this expression will be evaluated against each row and routed to the resulting partition if it exists (if the row is the first for a year, the partition will be created).

```sql
 CREATE TABLE posts
(
        `Id` Int32 CODEC(Delta(4), ZSTD(1)),
        `PostTypeId` Enum8('Question' = 1, 'Answer' = 2, 'Wiki' = 3, 'TagWikiExcerpt' = 4, 'TagWiki' = 5, 'ModeratorNomination' = 6, 'WikiPlaceholder' = 7, 'PrivilegeWiki' = 8),
        `AcceptedAnswerId` UInt32,
        `CreationDate` DateTime64(3, 'UTC'),
...
        `ClosedDate` DateTime64(3, 'UTC')
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (PostTypeId, toDate(CreationDate), CreationDate)
PARTITION BY toYear(CreationDate)
```

Read about setting the partition expression in a section [How to set the partition expression](/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition/#how-to-set-partition-expression).

In ClickHouse, users should principally consider partitioning to be a data management feature, not a query optimization technique. By separating data logically based on a key, each partition can be operated on independently e.g. deleted. This allows users to move partitions, and thus subsets, between [storage tiers](/integrations/s3#storage-tiers) efficiently on time or [expire data/efficiently delete from the cluster](/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition).

## Drop partitions {#drop-partitions}

`ALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION` provides a cost-efficient way to drop a whole partition.

``` sql
ALTER TABLE table_name [ON CLUSTER cluster] DROP PARTITION|PART partition_expr
```

This query tags the partition as inactive and deletes data completely, approximately in 10 minutes. The query is replicated – it deletes data on all replicas.

In example, below we remove posts from 2008 for the earlier table by dropping the associated partition.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT partition
FROM system.parts
WHERE `table` = 'posts'
