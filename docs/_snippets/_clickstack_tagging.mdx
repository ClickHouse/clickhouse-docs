You can add tags to dashboards and saved searches to help organize them.
Tags provide a flexible way to categorize and filter based on your needs.

#### How tags work {#how-tags-work}

- **Organization**: Tags appear in the left sidebar, where dashboards and saved searches are grouped by their assigned tags
- **Multiple tags**: You can add one or more tags to a single item for better categorization
- **Auto-creation**: If you assign a tag that doesn't exist yet, it will be automatically created
- **Easy management**: You can add or remove tags at any time to adjust your organization structure

This makes it easy to find related items and maintain an organized workspace as your collection grows.
