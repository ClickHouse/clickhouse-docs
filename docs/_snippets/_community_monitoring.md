## Community monitoring solutions {#community-monitoring}

The ClickHouse community has developed comprehensive monitoring solutions that integrate with popular observability stacks. [ClickHouse Monitoring](https://github.com/duyet/clickhouse-monitoring) provides a complete monitoring setup with pre-built dashboards. This open source project offers a quick-start approach for teams looking to implement ClickHouse monitoring with established best practices and proven dashboard configurations.

Like other direct database monitoring approaches, this solution queries ClickHouse system tables directly, which prevents instances from idling and impacts cost optimization.
