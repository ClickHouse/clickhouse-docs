:::note Compatibility
If you're noticing differences in behavior between your self-hosted ClickHouse deployment and your ClickHouse Cloud service,
it may be related to the [compatibility setting](/operations/settings/settings#compatibility).
In Cloud, compatibility is set when a service is created and doesn't change at the service level to ensure that clients get consistent behavior even as the service upgrades.
If you wish to change compatibility, you may request to do so via [support](https://clickhouse.com/support/program).
