# Managing data

Deployments of ClickHouse for Observability invariably involve large datasets, which need to be managed. ClickHouse offers a number of features to assist with data management.

## Partitions {#partitions}

Partitioning in ClickHouse allows data to be logically separated on disk according to a column or SQL expression. By separating data logically, each partition can be operated on independently e.g. deleted. This allows users to move partitions, and thus subsets, between storage tiers efficiently on time or [expire data/efficiently delete from a cluster](/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition).

Partitioning is specified on a table when it is initially defined via the `PARTITION BY` clause. This clause can contain a SQL expression on any column/s, the results of which will define which partition a row is sent to.

<Image img={observability_14} alt="Partitions" size="md"/>

The data parts are logically associated (via a common folder name prefix) with each partition on the disk and can be queried in isolation. For the example below, default `otel_logs` schema partitions by day using the expression `toDate(Timestamp)`. As rows are inserted into ClickHouse, this expression will be evaluated against each row and routed to the resulting partition if it exists (if the row is the first for a day, the partition will be created).

```sql
CREATE TABLE default.otel_logs
(
...
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY toDate(Timestamp)
ORDER BY (ServiceName, SeverityText, toUnixTimestamp(Timestamp), TraceId)
```

A [number of operations](/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition) can be performed on partitions, including [backups](/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition#freeze-partition), [column manipulations](/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition#clear-column-in-partition), mutations [altering](/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition#update-in-partition)/[deleting](/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition#delete-in-partition) data by row) and [index clearing (e.g. secondary indices)](/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition#clear-index-in-partition).

As an example, suppose our `otel_logs` table is partitioned by day. If populated with the structured log dataset, this will contain several days of data:

```sql
SELECT Timestamp::Date AS day,
         count() AS c
FROM otel_logs
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY c DESC

┌────────day─┬───────c─┐

```

Current partitions can be found using a simple system table query:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT partition
FROM system.parts
WHERE `table` = 'otel_logs'

┌─partition──┐
│ 2019-01-22 │
│ 2019-01-23 │

│ 2019-01-25 │
│ 2019-01-26 │
└────────────┘

5 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.005 sec.
```

We may have another table, `otel_logs_archive`, which we use to store older data. Data can be moved to this table efficiently by partition (this is just a metadata change).

```sql
CREATE TABLE otel_logs_archive AS otel_logs
--move data to archive table
ALTER TABLE otel_logs
        (MOVE PARTITION tuple('2019-01-26') TO TABLE otel_logs_archive
--confirm data has been moved
SELECT
        Timestamp::Date AS day,
        count() AS c
FROM otel_logs
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY c DESC

┌────────day─┬───────c─┐

│ 2019-01-23 │ 2326694 │
│ 2019-01-24 │ 1896255 │
│ 2019-01-25 │ 1821770 │
└────────────┴─────────┘

4 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.051 sec. Processed 8.38 million rows, 67.03 MB (163.52 million rows/s., 1.31 GB/s.)
Peak memory usage: 4.40 MiB.

SELECT Timestamp::Date AS day,
        count() AS c
FROM otel_logs_archive
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY c DESC

└────────────┴─────────┘

Peak memory usage: 4.99 MiB.
```

This is in contrast to other techniques, which would require the use of an `INSERT INTO SELECT` and a rewrite of the data into the new target table.

:::note Moving partitions
[Moving partitions between tables](/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition#move-partition-to-table) requires several conditions to be met, not least tables must have the same structure, partition key, primary key and indices/projections. Detailed notes on how to specify partitions in `ALTER` DDL can be found [here](/sql-reference/statements/alter/partition#how-to-set-partition-expression).
:::

Furthermore, data can be efficiently deleted by partition. This is far more resource-efficient than alternative techniques (mutations or lightweight deletes) and should be preferred.

```sql
ALTER TABLE otel_logs
        (DROP PARTITION tuple('2019-01-25'))

SELECT
        Timestamp::Date AS day,
        count() AS c
FROM otel_logs
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY c DESC
┌────────day─┬───────c─┐
│ 2019-01-22 │ 4667954 │
│ 2019-01-23 │ 4653388 │
│ 2019-01-24 │ 3792510 │
└────────────┴─────────┘
```

:::note
This feature is exploited by TTL when the setting [`ttl_only_drop_parts=1`](/operations/settings/merge-tree-settings#ttl_only_drop_parts) is used. See [Data management with TTL](#data-management-with-ttl-time-to-live) for further details.
:::

### Applications {#applications}

The above illustrates how data can be efficiently moved and manipulated by partition. In reality, users will likely most frequently exploit partition operations in Observability use cases for two scenarios:

- **Tiered architectures** - Moving data between storage tiers (see [Storage tiers](#storage-tiers)), thus allowing hot-cold architectures to be constructed.
- **Efficient deletion** - when data has reached a specified TTL (see [Data management with TTL](#data-management-with-ttl-time-to-live))

We explore both of these in detail below.

### Query performance {#query-performance}

While partitions can assist with query performance, this depends heavily on the access patterns. If queries target only a few partitions (ideally one), performance can potentially improve. This is only typically useful if the partitioning key is not in the primary key and you are filtering by it. However, queries which need to cover many partitions may perform worse than if no partitioning is used (as there may possibly be more parts). The benefit of targeting a single partition will be even less pronounced to non-existent if the partitioning key is already an early entry in the primary key. Partitioning can also be used to [optimize GROUP BY queries](/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/custom-partitioning-key#group-by-optimisation-using-partition-key) if values in each partition are unique. However, in general, users should ensure the primary key is optimized and only consider partitioning as a query optimization technique in exceptional cases where access patterns access a specific predictable subset of the data, e.g., partitioning by day, with most queries in the last day. See [here](https://medium.com/datadenys/using-partitions-in-clickhouse-3ea0decb89c4) for an example of this behavior.

## Data management with TTL (Time-to-live) {#data-management-with-ttl-time-to-live}

Time-to-Live (TTL) is a crucial feature in observability solutions powered by ClickHouse for efficient data retention and management, especially given vast amounts of data are continuously generated. Implementing TTL in ClickHouse allows for automatic expiration and deletion of older data, ensuring that the storage is optimally used and performance is maintained without manual intervention. This capability is essential for keeping the database lean, reducing storage costs, and ensuring that queries remain fast and efficient by focusing on the most relevant and recent data. Moreover, it helps in compliance with data retention policies by systematically managing data life cycles, thus enhancing the overall sustainability and scalability of the observability solution.

TTL can be specified at either the table or column level in ClickHouse.

### Table level TTL {#table-level-ttl}

The default schema for both logs and traces includes a TTL to expire data after a specified period. This is specified in the ClickHouse exporter under a `ttl` key e.g.

```yaml
exporters:
 clickhouse:
   endpoint: tcp://localhost:9000?dial_timeout=10s&compress=lz4&async_insert=1
   ttl: 72h
```

This syntax currently supports [Golang Duration syntax](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration). **We recommend users use `h` and ensure this aligns with the partitioning period. For example, if you partition by day, ensure it is a multiple of days, e.g., 24h, 48h, 72h.** This will automatically ensure a TTL clause is added to the table e.g. if `ttl: 96h`.

```sql
PARTITION BY toDate(Timestamp)
ORDER BY (ServiceName, SpanName, toUnixTimestamp(Timestamp), TraceId)
TTL toDateTime(Timestamp) + toIntervalDay(4)
SETTINGS ttl_only_drop_parts = 1
```

By default, data with an expired TTL is removed when ClickHouse [merges data parts](/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree#mergetree-data-storage). When ClickHouse detects that data is expired, it performs an off-schedule merge.

:::note Scheduled TTLs
TTLs are not applied immediately but rather on a schedule, as noted above. The MergeTree table setting `merge_with_ttl_timeout` sets the minimum delay in seconds before repeating a merge with delete TTL. The default value is 14400 seconds (4 hours). But that is just the minimum delay, it can take longer until a TTL merge is triggered. If the value is too low, it will perform many off-schedule merges that may consume a lot of resources. A TTL expiration can be forced using the command `ALTER TABLE my_table MATERIALIZE TTL`.
:::

**Important: We recommend using the setting [`ttl_only_drop_parts=1`](/operations/settings/merge-tree-settings#ttl_only_drop_parts) ** (applied by the default schema). When this setting is enabled, ClickHouse drops a whole part when all rows in it are expired. Dropping whole parts instead of partial cleaning TTL-d rows (achieved through resource-intensive mutations when `ttl_only_drop_parts=0`) allows having shorter `merge_with_ttl_timeout` times and lower impact on system performance. If data is partitioned by the same unit at which you perform TTL expiration e.g. day, parts will naturally only contain data from the defined interval. This will ensure `ttl_only_drop_parts=1` can be efficiently applied.

### Column level TTL {#column-level-ttl}

The above example expires data at a table level. Users can also expire data at a column level. As data ages, this can be used to drop columns whose value in investigations does not justify their resource overhead to retain. For example, we recommend retaining the `Body` column in case new dynamic metadata is added that has not been extracted at insert time, e.g., a new Kubernetes label. After a period e.g. 1 month, it might be obvious that this additional metadata is not useful - thus limiting the value in retaining the `Body` column.

Below, we show how the `Body` column can be dropped after 30 days.

```sql
CREATE TABLE otel_logs_v2
(
        `Body` String TTL Timestamp + INTERVAL 30 DAY,
        `Timestamp` DateTime,
        ...
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (ServiceName, Timestamp)
```

:::note
Specifying a column level TTL requires users to specify their own schema. This cannot be specified in the OTel collector.
:::

## Recompressing data {#recompressing-data}

While we typically recommend `ZSTD(1)` for observability datasets, users can experiment with different compression algorithms or higher levels of compression e.g. `ZSTD(3)`. As well as being able to specify this on schema creation, the compression can be configured to change after a set period. This may be appropriate if a codec or compression algorithm improves compression but causes poorer query performance. This tradeoff might be acceptable on older data, which is queried less frequently, but not for recent data, which is subject to more frequent use in investigations.

An example of this is shown below, where we compress the data using `ZSTD(3)` after 4 days instead of deleting it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE default.otel_logs_v2
(
        `Body` String,
        `Timestamp` DateTime,
        `ServiceName` LowCardinality(String),
        `Status` UInt16,
        `RequestProtocol` LowCardinality(String),
        `RunTime` UInt32,
        `Size` UInt32,
        `UserAgent` String,
        `Referer` String,
        `RemoteUser` String,
        `RequestType` LowCardinality(String),
        `RequestPath` String,
        `RemoteAddress` IPv4,
        `RefererDomain` String,
        `RequestPage` String,
        `SeverityText` LowCardinality(String),
        `SeverityNumber` UInt8,
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (ServiceName, Timestamp)
TTL Timestamp + INTERVAL 4 DAY RECOMPRESS CODEC(ZSTD(3))
```

:::note Evaluate performance
We recommend users always evaluate both the insert and query performance impact of different compression levels and algorithms. For example, delta codecs can be helpful in the compression of timestamps. However, if these are part of the primary key then filtering performance can suffer.
:::

Further details and examples on configuring TTL can be found [here](/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree#table_engine-mergetree-multiple-volumes). Examples such as how TTLs can be added and modified for tables and columns, can be found [here](/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree#table_engine-mergetree-ttl). For how TTLs enable storage hierarchies such as hot-warm architectures, see [Storage tiers](#storage-tiers).

## Storage tiers {#storage-tiers}

In ClickHouse, users may create storage tiers on different disks, e.g. hot/recent data on SSD and older data backed by S3. This architecture allows less expensive storage to be used for older data, which has higher query SLAs due to its infrequent use in investigations.

:::note Not relevant to ClickHouse Cloud
ClickHouse Cloud uses a single copy of the data that is backed on S3, with SSD-backed node caches. Storage tiers in ClickHouse Cloud, therefore, are not required.
:::

The creation of storage tiers requires users to create disks, which are then used to formulate storage policies, with volumes that can be specified during table creation. Data can be automatically moved between disks based on fill rates, part sizes, and volume priorities. Further details can be found [here](/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/mergetree#table_engine-mergetree-multiple-volumes).

While data can be manually moved between disks using the `ALTER TABLE MOVE PARTITION` command, the movement of data between volumes can also be controlled using TTLs. A full example can be found [here](/guides/developer/ttl#implementing-a-hotwarmcold-architecture).

## Managing schema changes {#managing-schema-changes}

Log and trace schemas will invariably change over the lifetime of a system e.g. as users monitor new systems which have different metadata or pod labels. By producing data using the OTel schema, and capturing the original event data in structured format, ClickHouse schemas will be robust to these changes. However, as new metadata becomes available and query access patterns change, users will want to update schemas to reflect these developments.

In order to avoid downtime during schema changes, users have several options, which we present below.

### Use default values {#use-default-values}

Columns can be added to the schema using [`DEFAULT` values](/sql-reference/statements/create/table#default). The specified default will be used if it is not specified during the INSERT.

Schema changes can be made prior to modifying any materialized view transformation logic or OTel collector configuration, which causes these new columns to be sent.

Once the schema has been changed, users can reconfigure OTel collectors. Assuming users are using the recommended process outlined in ["Extracting structure with SQL"](/docs/use-cases/observability/schema-design#extracting-structure-with-sql), where OTel collectors send their data to a Null table engine with a materialized view responsible for extracting the target schema and sending the results to a target table for storage, the view can be modified using the [`ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY QUERY` syntax](/sql-reference/statements/alter/view). Suppose we have the target table below with its corresponding materialized view (similar to that used in "Extracting structure with SQL") to extract the target schema from the OTel structured logs:

```sql
CREATE TABLE default.otel_logs_v2
(
        `Body` String,
        `Timestamp` DateTime,
        `ServiceName` LowCardinality(String),
        `Status` UInt16,
        `RequestProtocol` LowCardinality(String),
        `RunTime` UInt32,
        `UserAgent` String,
        `Referer` String,
        `RemoteUser` String,
        `RequestType` LowCardinality(String),
        `RequestPath` String,
        `RemoteAddress` IPv4,
        `RefererDomain` String,
        `RequestPage` String,
        `SeverityText` LowCardinality(String),
        `SeverityNumber` UInt8
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (ServiceName, Timestamp)

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW otel_logs_mv TO otel_logs_v2 AS
SELECT
        Body,
        Timestamp::DateTime AS Timestamp,
        ServiceName,
        LogAttributes['status']::UInt16 AS Status,
        LogAttributes['request_protocol'] AS RequestProtocol,
        LogAttributes['run_time'] AS RunTime,
        LogAttributes['user_agent'] AS UserAgent,
        LogAttributes['referer'] AS Referer,
        LogAttributes['remote_user'] AS RemoteUser,
        LogAttributes['request_type'] AS RequestType,
        LogAttributes['request_path'] AS RequestPath,
        LogAttributes['remote_addr'] AS RemoteAddress,
        domain(LogAttributes['referer']) AS RefererDomain,
        path(LogAttributes['request_path']) AS RequestPage,
        multiIf(Status::UInt64 > 500, 'CRITICAL', Status::UInt64 > 400, 'ERROR', Status::UInt64 > 300, 'WARNING', 'INFO') AS SeverityText,
        multiIf(Status::UInt64 > 500, 20, Status::UInt64 > 400, 17, Status::UInt64 > 300, 13, 9) AS SeverityNumber
FROM otel_logs
```

Suppose we wish to extract a new column `Size` from the `LogAttributes`. We can add this to our schema with an `ALTER TABLE`, specifying the default value:

```sql
ALTER TABLE otel_logs_v2
        (ADD COLUMN `Size` UInt64 DEFAULT JSONExtractUInt(Body, 'size'))
```

In the above example, we specify the default as the `size` key in `LogAttributes` (this will be 0 if it doesn't exist). This means queries that access this column for rows that do not have the value inserted must access the Map and will, therefore, be slower. We could easily also specify this as a constant, e.g. 0, reducing the cost of subsequent queries against rows that do not have the value. Querying this table shows the value is populated as expected from the Map:

```sql
SELECT Size
FROM otel_logs_v2
LIMIT 5
┌──Size─┐
│ 30577 │
│  5667 │
│  5379 │
│  1696 │
│ 41483 │
└───────┘

5 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.012 sec.
```

To ensure this value is inserted for all future data, we can modify our materialized view using the `ALTER TABLE` syntax as shown below:

```sql
ALTER TABLE otel_logs_mv
        MODIFY QUERY
SELECT
        Body,
        Timestamp::DateTime AS Timestamp,
        ServiceName,
        LogAttributes['status']::UInt16 AS Status,
        LogAttributes['request_protocol'] AS RequestProtocol,
        LogAttributes['run_time'] AS RunTime,
        LogAttributes['size'] AS Size,
        LogAttributes['user_agent'] AS UserAgent,
        LogAttributes['referer'] AS Referer,
        LogAttributes['remote_user'] AS RemoteUser,
        LogAttributes['request_type'] AS RequestType,
        LogAttributes['request_path'] AS RequestPath,
        LogAttributes['remote_addr'] AS RemoteAddress,
        domain(LogAttributes['referer']) AS RefererDomain,
        path(LogAttributes['request_path']) AS RequestPage,
        multiIf(Status::UInt64 > 500, 'CRITICAL', Status::UInt64 > 400, 'ERROR', Status::UInt64 > 300,                 'WARNING', 'INFO') AS SeverityText,
        multiIf(Status::UInt64 > 500, 20, Status::UInt64 > 400, 17, Status::UInt64 > 300, 13, 9) AS SeverityNumber
FROM otel_logs
```

Subsequent rows will have a `Size` column populated at insert time.

### Create new tables {#create-new-tables}

As an alternative to the above process, users can simply create a new target table with the new schema.  Any materialized views can then be modified to use the new table using the above `ALTER TABLE MODIFY QUERY.` With this approach, users can version their tables e.g. `otel_logs_v3`.

This approach leaves the users with multiple tables to query. To query across tables, users can use the [`merge` function](/sql-reference/table-functions/merge) which accepts wildcard patterns for the table name. We demonstrate this below by querying a v2 and v3 of the `otel_logs` table:

```sql
SELECT Status, count() AS c
FROM merge('otel_logs_v[2|3]')
GROUP BY Status
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 5

┌─Status─┬────────c─┐
│   200  │ 38319300 │
│   304  │  1360912 │
│   302  │   799340 │
│   404  │   420044 │
│   301  │   270212 │
└────────┴──────────┘

5 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.137 sec. Processed 41.46 million rows, 82.92 MB (302.43 million rows/s., 604.85 MB/s.)
```

Should users wish to avoid using the `merge` function and expose a table to end users that combines multiple tables, the [Merge table engine](/engines/table-engines/special/merge) can be used. We demonstrate this below:

```sql
CREATE TABLE otel_logs_merged
ENGINE = Merge('default', 'otel_logs_v[2|3]')

SELECT Status, count() AS c
FROM otel_logs_merged
GROUP BY Status
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 5

┌─Status─┬────────c─┐
│   200  │ 38319300 │
│   304  │  1360912 │
│   302  │   799340 │
│   404  │   420044 │
│   301  │   270212 │
└────────┴──────────┘

5 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.073 sec. Processed 41.46 million rows, 82.92 MB (565.43 million rows/s., 1.13 GB/s.)
```

This can be updated whenever a new table is added using the `EXCHANGE` table syntax. For example, to add a v4 table we can create a new table and exchange this atomically with the previous version.

```sql
CREATE TABLE otel_logs_merged_temp
ENGINE = Merge('default', 'otel_logs_v[2|3|4]')

EXCHANGE TABLE otel_logs_merged_temp AND otel_logs_merged

SELECT Status, count() AS c
FROM otel_logs_merged
GROUP BY Status
ORDER BY c DESC
LIMIT 5

┌─Status─┬────────c─┐
│   200  │ 39259996 │
│   304  │  1378564 │
│   302  │   820118 │
│   404  │   429220 │
│   301  │   276960 │
└────────┴──────────┘

5 rows in set. Elapsed: 0.068 sec. Processed 42.46 million rows, 84.92 MB (620.45 million rows/s., 1.24 GB/s.)
```
