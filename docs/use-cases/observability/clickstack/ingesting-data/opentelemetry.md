All data is ingested into ClickStack via an **OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector** instance, which acts as the primary entry point for logs, metrics, traces, and session data. We recommend using the official [ClickStack distribution](#installing-otel-collector) of the collector for this instance.

Users send data to this collector from [language SDKs](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/sdks) or through data collection agents collecting infrastructure metrics and logs (such OTel collectors in an [agent](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/ingesting-data/otel-collector#collector-roles) role or other technologies e.g. [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) or [Vector](https://vector.dev/)). For teams that want a managed OpenTelemetry pipeline, [Bindplane](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/integration-partners/bindplane)offers an OpenTelemetry-native solution with a native ClickStack destination, simplifying telemetry collection, processing, and routing.

### Installing ClickStack OpenTelemetry collector {#installing-otel-collector-managed}

To send data to Managed ClickStack, an OTel collector should be deployed in a [gateway role](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/ingesting-data/otel-collector#collector-roles). OTel compatible instrumentation will send events to this collector via OTLP over HTTP or gRPC.

:::note We recommend using the ClickStack OpenTelemetry collector
This allows you to benefit from standardized ingestion, enforced schemas, and out-of-the-box compatibility with the ClickStack UI (HyperDX). Using the default schema enables automatic source detection and preconfigured column mappings.
:::

For further details see ["Deploying the collector"](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/ingesting-data/otel-collector).

### Sending data to the collector {#sending-data-to-collector-managed}

To send data to Managed ClickStack, point your OpenTelemetry instrumentation to the following endpoints made available by the OpenTelemetry collector:

- **HTTP (OTLP):** `http://localhost:4318`
- **gRPC (OTLP):** `localhost:4317`

For [language SDKs](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/sdks) and telemetry libraries that support OpenTelemetry, you can simply set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable in your application:

```shell
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
```

If deploying a [contrib distribution of the OTel collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) in the agent role, can use the OTLP exporter to send to the ClickStack collector. An example agent config consuming this [structured log file](https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/http_logs/access-structured.log.gz), is shown below.

```yaml
# clickhouse-agent-config.yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include:
      - /opt/data/logs/access-structured.log
    start_at: beginning
    operators:
      - type: json_parser
        timestamp:
          parse_from: attributes.time_local
          layout: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
exporters:
  # HTTP setup

    endpoint: 'http://localhost:4318'

  # gRPC setup (alternative)

```

The ClickStack OpenTelemetry collector is included in most ClickStack distributions, including:

- [All-in-One](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/deployment/all-in-one)
- [Docker Compose](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/deployment/docker-compose)
- [Helm](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/deployment/helm)

### Installing ClickStack OpenTelemetry collector {#installing-otel-collector}

The ClickStack OTel collector can also be deployed standalone, independent of other components of the stack.

If you're using the [HyperDX-only](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/deployment/hyperdx-only) distribution, you are responsible for delivering data into ClickHouse yourself. This can be done by:

- Running your own OpenTelemetry collector and pointing it at ClickHouse - see below.
- Sending directly to ClickHouse using alternative tooling, such as [Vector](https://vector.dev/), [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) etc, or even the default [OTel contrib collector distribution](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib).

:::note We recommend using the ClickStack OpenTelemetry collector
This allows you to benefit from standardized ingestion, enforced schemas, and out-of-the-box compatibility with the HyperDX UI. Using the default schema enables automatic source detection and preconfigured column mappings.

For further details see ["Deploying the collector"](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/ingesting-data/otel-collector).

### Sending data to the collector {#sending-data-to-collector-oss}

To send data to ClickStack, point your OpenTelemetry instrumentation to the following endpoints made available by the OpenTelemetry collector:

- **HTTP (OTLP):** `http://localhost:4318`
- **gRPC (OTLP):** `localhost:4317`

For [language SDKs](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/sdks) and telemetry libraries that support OpenTelemetry, you can simply set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable in your application:

```shell
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
```

In addition, an authorization header containing the API ingestion key is required. You can find the key in the HyperDX app under `Team Settings → API Keys`.

<Image img={ingestion_key} alt="Ingestion keys" size="lg"/>

For language SDKs, this can then either be set by an `init` function or via an`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable e.g.:

```shell
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS='authorization=<YOUR_INGESTION_API_KEY>'
```

Agents should likewise include this authorization header in any OTLP communication. For example, if deploying a [contrib distribution of the OTel collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) in the agent role, they can use the OTLP exporter. An example agent config consuming this [structured log file](https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/http_logs/access-structured.log.gz), is shown below. Note the need to specify an authorization key - see `<YOUR_API_INGESTION_KEY>`.

```yaml
# clickhouse-agent-config.yaml
receivers:
  filelog:
    include:
      - /opt/data/logs/access-structured.log
    start_at: beginning
    operators:
      - type: json_parser
        timestamp:
          parse_from: attributes.time_local
          layout: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
