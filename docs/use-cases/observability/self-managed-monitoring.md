# Self-Managed Monitoring {#cloud-monitoring}

This guide provides enterprise teams evaluating ClickHouse open-source with comprehensive information on monitoring and observability capabilities for production deployments. Enterprise customers frequently ask about out-of-the-box monitoring features, integration with existing observability stacks including tools like Datadog and AWS CloudWatch, and how ClickHouse’ss monitoring compares to self-hosted deployments.

### Prometheus-Based Integration Architecture {#prometheus}
ClickHouse exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics through different endpoints depending on your deployment model, each with distinct operational characteristics:

**Self-Managed/OSS ClickHouse**

Direct server Prometheus endpoint accessible via the standard /metrics endpoint on your ClickHouse server. This approach provides:
- Complete metric exposure: Full range of available ClickHouse metrics without built-in filtering
- Real-time metrics: Generated directly from system tables when scraped

**Direct system access** 

Queries production system tables, which adds monitoring load and prevents cost-saving idle states

### ClickStack Deployment Options {#clickstack-deployment}

- [Helm](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/deployment/helm): Recommended for Kubernetes-based debugging environments. Allows for environment-specific configuration, resource limits, and scaling via `values.yaml`.
- [Docker Compose](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/deployment/docker-compose): Deploys each component (ClickHouse, HyperDX, OTel collector, MongoDB) individually.
- [HyperDX Only](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/deployment/hyperdx-only): Standalone HyperDX container.

For complete deployment options and architecture details, see the [ClickStack documentation](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/overview) and [data ingestion guide](/use-cases/observability/clickstack/ingesting-data/overview).
