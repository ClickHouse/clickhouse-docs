ClickHouse offers unmatched speed, scale, and cost-efficiency for observability. This guide provides two paths depending on your needs:

## ClickStack - the ClickHouse observability stack {#clickstack}

The ClickHouse Observability Stack is our **recommended approach** for most users.

**ClickStack** is a production-grade observability platform built on ClickHouse and OpenTelemetry (OTel), unifying logs, traces, metrics and session in a single high-performance scalable solution that works from single-node deployments to **multi-petabyte** scale.

## Build-your-own stack {#build-your-own-stack}

For users with **custom requirements** — such as highly specialized ingestion pipelines, schema designs, or extreme scaling needs — we provide guidance to build a custom observability stack with ClickHouse as the core database.
