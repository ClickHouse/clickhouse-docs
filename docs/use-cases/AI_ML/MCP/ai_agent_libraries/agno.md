# How to build an AI Agent with Agno and the ClickHouse MCP Server

In this guide you'll learn how to build an [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) AI agent that can interact with 
[ClickHouse's SQL playground](https://sql.clickhouse.com/) using [ClickHouse's MCP Server](https://github.com/ClickHouse/mcp-clickhouse).

:::note Example notebook
This example can be found as a notebook in the [examples repository](https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/main/ai/mcp/agno/agno.ipynb).
:::

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}
- You'll need to have Python installed on your system.
- You'll need to have `pip` installed on your system.
- You'll need an Anthropic API key, or API key from another LLM provider

You can run the following steps either from your Python REPL or via script.

<VerticalStepper headerLevel="h2">

## Install libraries {#install-libraries}

Install the Agno library by running the following commands:

```python
!pip install -q --upgrade pip
!pip install -q agno
!pip install -q ipywidgets
```

## Setup credentials {#setup-credentials}

Next, you'll need to provide your Anthropic API key:

```python
import os, getpass
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter Anthropic API Key:")
```

```response title="Response"
Enter Anthropic API Key: ········
```

:::note Using another LLM provider
If you don't have an Anthropic API key, and want to use another LLM provider,
you can find the instructions for setting up your credentials in the [DSPy docs](https://dspy.ai/#__tabbed_1_1)
:::

Next, define the credentials needed to connect to the ClickHouse SQL playground:

```python
env = {
    "CLICKHOUSE_HOST": "sql-clickhouse.clickhouse.com",
    "CLICKHOUSE_PORT": "8443",
    "CLICKHOUSE_USER": "demo",
    "CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD": "",
    "CLICKHOUSE_SECURE": "true"
}
```

## Initialize MCP Server and Agno agent {#initialize-mcp-and-agent}

Now configure the ClickHouse MCP Server to point at the ClickHouse SQL playground 
and also initialize our Agno agent and ask it a question:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.tools.mcp import MCPTools
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
```

```python
async with MCPTools(command="uv run --with mcp-clickhouse --python 3.13 mcp-clickhouse", env=env, timeout_seconds=60) as mcp_tools:
    agent = Agent(
        model=Claude(id="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"),
        markdown=True,
        tools = [mcp_tools]
    )
await agent.aprint_response("What's the most starred project in 2025?", stream=True)
```

┃ To answer your question about the most starred project in 2025, I'll need to query the ClickHouse database.     ┃
┃ However, before I can do that, I need to gather some information and make sure we're looking at the right data. ┃
┃ Let me check the available databases and tables first.Thank you for providing the list of databases. I can see  ┃
┃ that there's a "github" database, which is likely to contain the information we're looking for. Let's check the ┃
┃ tables in this database.Now that we have information about the tables in the github database, we can query the  ┃
┃ relevant data to answer your question about the most starred project in 2025. We'll use the repo_events_per_day ┃
┃ table, which contains daily event counts for each repository, including star events (WatchEvents).              ┃

┃ Let's create a query to find the most starred project in 2025:Based on the query results, I can answer your     ┃
┃ question about the most starred project in 2025:                                                                ┃

┃ This project, DeepSeek-R1, appears to be an AI-related repository from the DeepSeek AI organization. It gained  ┃
┃ significant attention and popularity among the GitHub community in 2025, earning the highest number of stars    ┃
┃ for any project during that year.                                                                               ┃

┃ It's worth noting that this data is based on the GitHub events recorded in the database, and it represents the  ┃
┃ stars (WatchEvents) accumulated specifically during the year 2025. The total number of stars for this project   ┃
┃ might be higher if we consider its entire lifespan.                                                             ┃
