# How to build an AI Agent with DSPy and the ClickHouse MCP Server

In this guide, you'll learn how to build an AI agent with [DSPy](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) that
can interact with [ClickHouse's SQL playground](https://sql.clickhouse.com/) using [ClickHouse's MCP Server](https://github.com/ClickHouse/mcp-clickhouse).

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

- You'll need to have Python installed on your system.
- You'll need to have `pip` installed on your system.
- You'll need an Anthropic API key, or API key from another LLM provider

You can run the following steps either from your Python REPL or via script.

:::note Example notebook
This example can be found as a notebook in the [examples repository](https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/main/ai/mcp/dspy/dspy.ipynb).
:::

<VerticalStepper headerLevel="h2">

## Install libraries {#install-libraries}

Run the following commands using `pip` to install the required libraries:

```shell
!pip install -q --upgrade pip
!pip install -q dspy
!pip install -q mcp
```

## Setup credentials {#setup-credentials}

Next, you'll need to provide your Anthropic API key:

```python
import os
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter Anthropic API Key:")
```

:::note Using another LLM provider
If you don't have an Anthropic API key, and want to use another LLM provider,
you can find the instructions for setting up your credentials in the [DSPy docs](https://dspy.ai/#__tabbed_1_1)
:::

Next, define the credentials needed to connect to the ClickHouse SQL playground:

```python
env = {
    "CLICKHOUSE_HOST": "sql-clickhouse.clickhouse.com",
    "CLICKHOUSE_PORT": "8443",
    "CLICKHOUSE_USER": "demo",
    "CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD": "",
    "CLICKHOUSE_SECURE": "true"
}
```

## Initialize MCP Server {#initialize-mcp}

Now configure the ClickHouse MCP Server to point at the ClickHouse SQL playground.

```python
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client
import dspy

server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="uv",
    args=[
        'run',
        '--with', 'mcp-clickhouse',
        '--python', '3.13',
        'mcp-clickhouse'
    ],
    env=env
)
```

## Initialize LLM {#initialize-llm}

Next, initialize the LLM with the following line:

```python
dspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"))
```

## Run the agent {#run-the-agent}

Finally, initialize and run the agent:

```python
class DataAnalyst(dspy.Signature):
    """You are a data analyst. You'll be asked questions and you need to try to answer them using the tools you have access to. """

    user_request: str = dspy.InputField()
    process_result: str = dspy.OutputField(
        desc=(
            "Answer to the query"
        )
    )

from utils import print_dspy_result

async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        tools = await session.list_tools()

        dspy_tools = []
        for tool in tools.tools:
            dspy_tools.append(dspy.Tool.from_mcp_tool(session, tool))

        react = dspy.ReAct(DataAnalyst, tools=dspy_tools)
        result = await react.acall(user_request="What's the most popular Amazon product category")
        print_dspy_result(result)
```

üìç STEP 1
----------------------------------------
üß† THINKING: I need to find information about Amazon product categories and determine which one is most popular. First, I should explore what databases are available to see if there's any Amazon-related data.

üîß TOOL: list_databases

üìä RESULT:
   amazon

üìç STEP 2
----------------------------------------
üß† THINKING: Great! I can see there's an "amazon" database available. This is exactly what I need to find information about Amazon product categories. Let me explore the tables in the amazon database to see what data is available.

üîß TOOL: list_tables
   Args: {'database': 'amazon'}

üìä RESULT:
   {
  "database": "amazon",
  "name": "amazon_reviews",
  "comment": "",
  "columns": [
    {
      "name": "review_date",
      "type": "Date",
      "default_type": "",
      "default_expression": "",...

üìç STEP 3
----------------------------------------
üß† THINKING: Perfect! I found the amazon_reviews table which contains a product_category column. This table has over 150 million rows of Amazon review data, which should give me a good representation of product popularity. To find the most popular Amazon product category, I need to count the number of reviews per category and order them by count in descending order. The category with the most reviews would be considered the most popular.

üîß TOOL: run_select_query
   Args: {'query': 'SELECT product_category, COUNT(*) as review_count FROM amazon.amazon_reviews GROUP BY product_category ORDER BY review_count DESC LIMIT 10'}

üìä RESULT:
   1. Books: 19,530,930 reviews
   2. Digital_Ebook_Purchase: 17,622,107 reviews
   3. Wireless: 9,001,567 reviews
   4. PC: 6,908,245 reviews
   5. Home: 6,221,321 reviews
   ... and 5 more

üìç STEP 4
----------------------------------------
üß† THINKING: Perfect! I have found the answer to the user's question. Based on the Amazon reviews data, I can clearly see that "Books" is the most popular Amazon product category with 19,530,930 reviews, followed by "Digital_Ebook_Purchase" with 17,622,107 reviews. The data shows a clear ranking of product categories by popularity based on the number of reviews each category has received. I now have all the information needed to answer the user's question.

üîß TOOL: finish

üìä RESULT:
   Completed.

üéØ REASONING
----------------------------------------
To answer the question about the most popular Amazon product category, I accessed the Amazon database and found a table called "amazon_reviews" with over 150 million review records. This table contains a "product_category" column that allows me to analyze product popularity based on review volume. I ran a query to count the number of reviews per product category and ordered them by count in descending order. The assumption here is that categories with more reviews indicate higher popularity, as more reviews typically correlate with more purchases and customer engagement.

‚úÖ FINAL RESULT
----------------------------------------
Based on Amazon review data containing over 150 million records, the most popular Amazon product category is **Books** with 19,530,930 reviews. 

Here are the top 10 most popular Amazon product categories by review count:

1. **Books** - 19,530,930 reviews
2. **Digital_Ebook_Purchase** - 17,622,107 reviews  
3. **Wireless** - 9,001,567 reviews
4. **PC** - 6,908,245 reviews
5. **Home** - 6,221,321 reviews
6. **Apparel** - 5,906,085 reviews
7. **Health & Personal Care** - 5,331,239 reviews
8. **Beauty** - 5,115,462 reviews
9. **Video DVD** - 5,069,014 reviews
10. **Mobile_Apps** - 5,033,164 reviews

It's interesting to note that Books and Digital Ebook Purchase (which are related categories) together account for over 37 million reviews, showing the strong popularity of reading materials on Amazon's platform.
