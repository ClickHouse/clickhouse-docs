[Model Context Protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) (MCP) is a standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI assistants to seamlessly integrate with external systems. 
This protocol allows AI assistants to connect to data sources, APIs, databases, and more in a secure and standardized way.

MCP creates a universal interface between AI models and various services, eliminating the need for custom tool implementations for each integration. 
You can think of it as a universal API standard designed specifically for AI systems.

The key advantage of MCP is that AI libraries only need to implement support for the protocol once. 
After that, all MCP-compatible services become immediately accessible, saving AI library maintainers a lot of time.

## What is MCP's architecture?  {#mcp-architecture}

MCP follows a client-server architecture:

* Clients (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or VS Code) establish connections with MCP servers. You can see a collection of clients in the [awesome-mcp-clients](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-clients?tab=readme-ov-file#windsurf) GitHub repository.
* Servers expose tools and capabilities through standardized interfaces. You can see a collection of servers in the [awesome-mcp-servers](https://github.com/punkpeye/awesome-mcp-servers) GitHub repository.
* AI models can then use these tools to access external data and functionality when needed

A diagram showing the architecture is below:

## Does ClickHouse have an MCP Server? {#clickhouse-mcp-server}

It does!
The [ClickHouse MCP Server](https://github.com/ClickHouse/mcp-clickhouse) offers the following tools:

* `run_select_query` - Execute SQL queries on your ClickHouse cluster.
* `list_databases` - List all databases on your ClickHouse cluster.
* `list_tables` - List all tables in a database.
