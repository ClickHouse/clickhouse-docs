# Does ClickHouse support data lakes?

ClickHouse supports data lakes, including Iceberg, Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, Apache Paimon, Hive.

It provides support for **reading** and **writing**, full compatibility with partition pruning, statistics-based pruning, schema evolution, positional deletes, equality deletes, time travel, and introspection.

Data Lakes in ClickHouse are supported with **Unity**, **AWS Glue**, **Rest**, **Polaris**, and **Hive Metastore** catalogs, as well as individual tables.

Query performance on data lakes is top-notch thanks to distributed processing, efficient native Parquet reader, and data files caching.
