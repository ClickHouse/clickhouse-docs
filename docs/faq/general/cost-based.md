# Does ClickHouse have a cost-based optimizer?

ClickHouse has certain isolated cost-based optimization mechanics, such as: the order of reading columns is determined by the cost of reading compressed ranges of data from disk.

ClickHouse also does JOIN reordering based on column statistics, however, this is (as of 2025) not nearly as advanced as CBE in Postgres, Oracle, MS SQL Server.
