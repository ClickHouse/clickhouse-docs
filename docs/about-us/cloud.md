## What version of ClickHouse does ClickHouse Cloud use? {#what-version-of-clickhouse-does-clickhouse-cloud-use}

Clickhouse Cloud continuously upgrades your service to a newer version. After publishing a core database version in the open source, we do additional validation in our cloud staging environment, which typically takes 6-8 weeks before rolling out to production. The rollout is phased out by cloud service provider, service type, and region.

We offer a "Fast" Release Channel for subscribing to updates ahead of the regular release schedule. For more details, see ["Fast Release Channel"](/manage/updates#fast-release-channel-early-upgrades).

If you rely on functionality in the earlier version, you can, in some cases, revert to the previous behavior using your service's compatibility setting.
