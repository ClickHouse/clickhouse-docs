# Error 49: LOGICAL_ERROR

:::tip
This error indicates an internal bug or assertion failure in ClickHouse that should not occur under normal circumstances.
It represents a violation of internal invariants or unexpected conditions that point to a bug in ClickHouse itself rather than a user error.
:::

## Most common causes {#most-common-causes}

1. **Internal assertion failures**
    - Failed internal consistency checks
    - Invariant violations in ClickHouse code
    - Unexpected state transitions that should never happen
    - Buffer or pointer validation failures

2. **File system cache issues**
    - Inconsistent cache state in S3 or remote filesystem operations
    - Buffer offset mismatches (e.g., "Expected X >= Y")
    - File segment inconsistencies

3. **Merge tree operations**
    - Part management issues (e.g., "Entry actual part isn't empty yet")
    - Temporary part conflicts
    - Part state inconsistencies during merges or mutations

4. **Query optimizer or planner bugs**
    - Incorrect operand types in expressions
    - Invalid query plan generation
    - Column type mismatches in internal processing

5. **Concurrency and synchronization issues**
    - Race conditions in multi-threaded operations
    - Lock ordering violations
    - State corruption from concurrent access

6. **LLVM compilation errors**
    - Incorrect operand types in compiled expressions
    - JIT compilation failures

## What to do when you encounter this error {#what-to-do}

**1. This is a bug - report it to ClickHouse**

`LOGICAL_ERROR` always indicates a bug in ClickHouse, not a user error. The error message typically says "Report this error to [https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues)"

**2. Gather diagnostic information**

Before reporting, collect:

```sql
-- Get the full error message and stack trace from logs
SELECT 
    event_time,
    query_id,
    exception,
    exception_code,
    stack_trace
FROM system.query_log
WHERE exception_code = 49
ORDER BY event_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**3. Note your ClickHouse version**

```sql
SELECT version();
```

**4. Try to create a minimal reproducible example**

If possible, identify:
- The specific query that triggers the error
- Table schema and sample data
- Any recent operations (merges, mutations, `ALTER` statements)

**5. Check if the issue is already fixed**

Search existing issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues)
Consider upgrading to a newer version if available.

## Temporary workarounds {#temporary-workarounds}

While waiting for a fix, you may try:

**1. Restart the server or retry the operation**

```bash
# Sometimes temporary state corruption can be cleared
sudo systemctl restart clickhouse-server
```

**2. Optimize or rebuild affected parts**

```sql
-- For specific table issues
OPTIMIZE TABLE your_table FINAL;

-- Or detach and reattach the table
DETACH TABLE your_table;
ATTACH TABLE your_table;
```

**3. Disable experimental features**

```sql
-- If using experimental features, try disabling them
SET allow_experimental_analyzer = 0;
SET compile_expressions = 0;
```

**4. Adjust settings that may trigger the bug**

```sql
-- For filesystem cache issues
SET enable_filesystem_cache = 0;

-- For query optimization issues
SET query_plan_enable_optimizations = 0;
```

**5. Use alternative query formulation**

If a specific query pattern triggers the error, try rewriting the query differently.

## Common specific scenarios {#common-scenarios}

**Scenario 1: Buffer offset mismatch**

```text
Logical error: 'Expected 46044 >= 88088'
```

This typically occurs with S3 or remote filesystem cache. Try:
- Clearing the filesystem cache
- Disabling cache temporarily
- Upgrading to a newer version

**Scenario 2: Part management errors**

```text
Logical error: 'Entry actual part isn't empty yet'
```

Related to merge tree part operations. Try:
- `OPTIMIZE TABLE FINAL`
- Checking for stuck merges in `system.merges`
- Checking mutations in `system.mutations`

**Scenario 3: LLVM compilation errors**

```text
Logical error: Incorrect operand type
```

Related to expression compilation. Try:

```sql
SET compile_expressions = 0;
SET compile_aggregate_expressions = 0;
```
