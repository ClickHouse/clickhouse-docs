# Error 439: CANNOT_SCHEDULE_TASK

:::tip
This error occurs when ClickHouse cannot allocate a new thread from the thread pool to execute a task.
It indicates that either the thread pool is exhausted (all threads busy), system thread limit is reached, or the OS cannot create new threads.
:::

## Most common causes {#most-common-causes}

1. **Thread pool exhausted**
    - All threads in pool busy with active tasks
    - Too many concurrent queries requesting threads
    - Thread pool size limit reached (threads = max pool size)
    - Jobs queued waiting for available threads

2. **System thread limit reached**
    - OS kernel thread limit exceeded
    - `ulimit -u` (max user processes) reached
    - System-wide thread limit hit
    - Container or cgroup thread limit reached

3. **High query concurrency with max_threads settings**
    - Many queries each requesting [`max_threads`](/operations/settings/settings#max_threads) threads
    - [`max_insert_threads`](/operations/settings/settings#max_insert_threads) setting too high with many concurrent inserts
    - Thread demand exceeds available thread pool capacity
    - Spike in concurrent query workload

4. **Resource exhaustion**
    - System cannot allocate memory for new threads
    - Out of memory for thread stack allocation
    - System resource limits preventing thread creation
    - Container memory limits affecting thread creation

5. **Misconfigured thread pool settings**
    - [`max_thread_pool_size`](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#max_thread_pool_size) set too low for workload
    - Thread pool not properly sized for concurrent queries
    - Imbalance between query concurrency and thread availability

## Common solutions {#common-solutions}

**1. Check current thread usage**

```sql
-- View current thread pool status
SELECT 
    metric,
    value
FROM system.metrics
WHERE metric LIKE '%Thread%'
ORDER BY metric;

-- Key metrics to check:
-- QueryPipelineExecutorThreads - active query execution threads
-- QueryPipelineExecutorThreadsActive - threads currently executing
-- GlobalThread - total threads in global pool
```

**2. Check thread pool configuration**

```sql
-- View thread pool settings
SELECT 
    name,
    value,
    description
FROM system.server_settings
WHERE name LIKE '%thread%'
ORDER BY name;

-- Key settings:
-- max_thread_pool_size - maximum threads in global pool
-- max_thread_pool_free_size - idle threads kept in pool
-- thread_pool_queue_size - max tasks waiting in queue
```

**3. Reduce per-query thread usage**

```sql
-- Limit threads for specific query
SELECT * FROM large_table
SETTINGS max_threads = 4;

-- Reduce insert threads
INSERT INTO table
SETTINGS max_insert_threads = 4;

-- Set user-level defaults
ALTER USER your_user SETTINGS max_threads = 8;
```

**4. Check system thread limits**

```bash
# Check current thread limits
ulimit -u

# Check system-wide limits
cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max

# Check current thread count
ps -eLf | wc -l

# For containers, check cgroup limits
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/pids/pids.max
```

**5. Enable concurrency control (if available)**

```sql
-- Check concurrency control settings
SELECT 
    name,
    value
FROM system.server_settings
WHERE name LIKE '%concurrent_threads_soft_limit%';

-- concurrent_threads_soft_limit_ratio_to_cores - limits threads per core
-- concurrent_threads_soft_limit_num - absolute thread limit
```

:::note
Concurrency control was broken in versions before October 2024 fix.
Fixed properly in 24.10+.
:::

**6. Monitor and limit concurrent queries**

```sql
-- Check concurrent query count
SELECT count() AS concurrent_queries
FROM system.processes;

-- Limit concurrent queries per user
ALTER USER your_user SETTINGS max_concurrent_queries_for_user = 10;

-- Check thread usage per query
SELECT 
    query_id,
    user,
    ProfileEvents['QueryPipelineExecutorThreads'] AS threads_used,
    query
FROM system.processes
ORDER BY threads_used DESC;
```

## Common scenarios {#common-scenarios}

**Scenario 1: No free threads in pool**

```text
Error: Cannot schedule a task: no free thread (timeout=0) 
(threads=15000, jobs=15000)
```

**Cause:** Thread pool completely saturated; all 15000 threads busy.

**Solution:**
- Reduce concurrent query load
- Lower [`max_threads`](/operations/settings/settings#max_threads) and [`max_insert_threads`](/operations/settings/settings#max_insert_threads) settings
- Increase [`max_thread_pool_size](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#max_thread_pool_size) if system can handle it
- Wait for queries to complete and retry

**Scenario 2: Failed to start thread**

```text
Error: Cannot schedule a task: failed to start the thread 
(threads=14755, jobs=14754)
```

**Cause:** System unable to create new thread (OS or resource limit).

**Solution:**

```bash
# Increase system limits
ulimit -u 65535

# Or in /etc/security/limits.conf
* soft nproc 65535
* hard nproc 65535

# Increase kernel limits
sysctl -w kernel.threads-max=100000
sysctl -w kernel.pid_max=100000
```

**Scenario 3: Cannot allocate thread**

```text
Error: Cannot schedule a task: cannot allocate thread
```

**Cause:** Memory or system resources insufficient for thread creation.

**Solution:**
- Check available memory: `free -h`
- Check if system is swapping: `vmstat 1`
- Reduce concurrent query load
- Increase system memory or reduce thread usage

**Scenario 4: Insert spike with `max_insert_threads`**

```text
Error: CANNOT_SCHEDULE_TASK during high insert load
```

**Cause:** Many concurrent inserts each using high [`max_insert_threads`](/operations/settings/settings#max_insert_threads).

**Solution:**

```sql
-- Reduce insert threads globally
SET max_insert_threads = 4;

-- For specific insert
INSERT INTO table
SETTINGS max_insert_threads = 2;

-- Use async inserts to batch operations
SET async_insert = 1;
```

**Scenario 5: Query spike exhausting thread pool**

```text
Error appears during traffic spike
Multiple queries failing simultaneously
```

**Cause:** Sudden increase in concurrent queries.

**Solution:**
- Implement query queuing or rate limiting on client side
- Reduce `max_threads` per query
- Increase `max_thread_pool_size` (if system allows)
- Scale horizontally (add more replicas)

## Prevention tips {#prevention-tips}

1. **Set reasonable thread limits:** Don't use excessively high [`max_threads`](/operations/settings/settings#max_threads) values
2. **Monitor thread usage:** Track thread pool metrics regularly
3. **Configure system limits:** Ensure OS limits are appropriate for workload
4. **Use async inserts:** Reduce thread usage for insert workloads
5. **Implement rate limiting:** Control concurrent query load
6. **Scale horizontally:** Add replicas to distribute thread demand
7. **Optimize queries:** Efficient queries need fewer threads and complete faster

## Debugging steps {#debugging-steps}

1. **Check recent `CANNOT_SCHEDULE_TASK` errors:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       event_time,
       query_id,
       user,
       exception,
       query
   FROM system.query_log
   WHERE exception_code = 439
       AND event_date >= today() - 1
   ORDER BY event_time DESC
   LIMIT 20;
   ```

2. **Monitor thread pool metrics:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       event_time,
       CurrentMetric_GlobalThread AS global_threads,
       CurrentMetric_QueryPipelineExecutorThreads AS executor_threads,
       CurrentMetric_QueryPipelineExecutorThreadsActive AS active_threads,
       CurrentMetric_Query AS concurrent_queries
   FROM system.metric_log
   WHERE event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
   ORDER BY event_time DESC
   LIMIT 100;
   ```

3. **Check concurrent query patterns:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       toStartOfMinute(event_time) AS minute,
       count() AS query_count,
       countIf(exception_code = 439) AS thread_errors,
       avg(ProfileEvents['QueryPipelineExecutorThreads']) AS avg_threads
   FROM system.query_log
   WHERE event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
   GROUP BY minute
   ORDER BY minute DESC;
   ```

4. **Identify high thread-consuming queries:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       query_id,
       user,
       ProfileEvents['QueryPipelineExecutorThreads'] AS threads,
       ProfileEvents['QueryPipelineExecutorThreadsActive'] AS active_threads,
       normalizeQuery(query) AS query_pattern
   FROM system.query_log
   WHERE event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
       AND type = 'QueryFinish'
   ORDER BY threads DESC
   LIMIT 20;
   ```

5. **Check system thread limits:**

   ```bash
   # Check user process limit
   ulimit -u
   
   # Check current thread count
   ps -eLf | wc -l
   
   # Check system limits
   cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max
   cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
   
   # For containers
   cat /sys/fs/cgroup/pids/pids.current
   cat /sys/fs/cgroup/pids/pids.max
   ```

6. **Review thread pool configuration:**

   ```sql
   SELECT 
       name,
       value,
       default
   FROM system.server_settings
   WHERE name IN (
       'max_thread_pool_size',
       'max_thread_pool_free_size',
       'thread_pool_queue_size',
       'concurrent_threads_soft_limit_num',
       'concurrent_threads_soft_limit_ratio_to_cores'
   );
   ```

## Special considerations {#special-considerations}

**For ClickHouse Cloud:**
- Thread pool sized based on instance tier
- Cannot directly configure [`max_thread_pool_size`](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#max_thread_pool_size)
- Errors may indicate need to scale up instance
- Temporary spikes should be tolerated with retry logic

**Thread pool types:**
- **Global thread pool:** General query execution threads
- **Background pool:** Merges and mutations
- **IO pool:** Disk and network I/O operations
- **Schedule pool:** Background scheduled tasks

**Concurrency control:**
- Feature to limit threads based on CPU cores
- Was broken in versions before ~October 2024
- Fixed properly in 24.10+
- Settings: [`concurrent_threads_soft_limit_ratio_to_cores`](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#concurrent_threads_soft_limit_ratio_to_cores)

**Thread vs query limits:**
- [`max_concurrent_queries`](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#max_concurrent_queries) limits number of queries
- [`max_threads`](/operations/settings/settings#max_threads) limits threads per query
- Total threads = queries × threads_per_query
- Thread pool must accommodate total demand

## Thread-related settings {#thread-settings}

**Server-level (config.xml):**

```xml
<clickhouse>
    <!-- Maximum threads in global pool -->
    <max_thread_pool_size>10000</max_thread_pool_size>
    
    <!-- Idle threads kept in pool -->
    <max_thread_pool_free_size>1000</max_thread_pool_free_size>
    
    <!-- Max tasks waiting for threads -->
    <thread_pool_queue_size>10000</thread_pool_queue_size>
    
    <!-- Soft limit based on cores (if > 0) -->
    <concurrent_threads_soft_limit_ratio_to_cores>2</concurrent_threads_soft_limit_ratio_to_cores>
</clickhouse>
```

**Query-level:**

```sql
-- Threads for reading/processing
SET max_threads = 8;

-- Threads for parallel inserts
SET max_insert_threads = 4;

-- Threads for distributed queries
SET max_distributed_connections = 1024;

-- Background operations
SET background_pool_size = 16;
SET background_merges_mutations_concurrency_ratio = 2;
```

## System limit configuration {#system-limits}

**Linux ulimits:**

```bash
# Temporary increase
ulimit -u 65535

# Permanent configuration in /etc/security/limits.conf
clickhouse soft nproc 65535
clickhouse hard nproc 65535

# Or for all users
* soft nproc 65535
* hard nproc 65535
```

**Kernel parameters:**

```bash
# Increase thread limits
sysctl -w kernel.threads-max=200000
sysctl -w kernel.pid_max=200000

# Make permanent in /etc/sysctl.conf
kernel.threads-max = 200000
kernel.pid_max = 200000
```

**Container limits (Kubernetes):**

```yaml
# Pod spec - adjust if needed
spec:
  containers:
  - name: clickhouse
    resources:
      limits:
        # Memory affects thread creation
        memory: 32Gi
```

## Error message variations {#error-variations}

**"no free thread":**
- Thread pool at capacity
- All threads busy with tasks
- More common, usually temporary

**"failed to start the thread":**
- System failed to create new thread
- OS or resource limit reached
- More serious, indicates system issue

**"cannot allocate thread":**
- Memory allocation failed for thread
- System resource exhaustion
- May indicate memory pressure

## Monitoring thread health {#monitoring}

```sql
-- Real-time thread usage
SELECT 
    metric,
    value,
    description
FROM system.metrics
WHERE metric IN (
    'GlobalThread',
    'GlobalThreadActive',
    'LocalThread',
    'LocalThreadActive',
    'QueryPipelineExecutorThreads',
    'QueryPipelineExecutorThreadsActive'
);

-- Thread usage over time
SELECT 
    toStartOfMinute(event_time) AS minute,
    max(CurrentMetric_GlobalThread) AS max_threads,
    max(CurrentMetric_GlobalThreadActive) AS max_active,
    max(CurrentMetric_Query) AS max_queries
FROM system.metric_log
WHERE event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY minute
ORDER BY minute DESC;

-- Queries that failed due to thread exhaustion
SELECT 
    toStartOfMinute(event_time) AS minute,
    count() AS error_count,
    count(DISTINCT user) AS affected_users
FROM system.query_log
WHERE exception_code = 439
    AND event_date >= today() - 7
GROUP BY minute
HAVING error_count > 0
ORDER BY minute DESC;
```

## Recovery and mitigation {#recovery}

**Immediate actions:**
1. **Wait and retry** - Thread pool may free up quickly
2. **Kill long-running queries** - Free up threads
   ```sql
   -- Find long-running queries
   SELECT query_id, user, elapsed, query
   FROM system.processes
   WHERE elapsed > 300
   ORDER BY elapsed DESC;
   
   -- Kill if appropriate
   KILL QUERY WHERE query_id = 'long_running_query';
   ```

3. **Reduce query load** - Temporarily throttle queries on client side
4. **Restart ClickHouse** - Clears thread pool (last resort)

**Long-term fixes:**

1. **Optimize query thread usage:**
   ```sql
   -- Set sensible defaults
   ALTER USER default SETTINGS max_threads = 8;
   ALTER USER default SETTINGS max_insert_threads = 4;
   ```

2. **Increase thread pool size** (if system can handle it):

   ```xml
   <max_thread_pool_size>20000</max_thread_pool_size>
   ```

3. **Configure concurrency control:**

   ```xml
   <!-- Limit threads based on CPU cores -->
   <concurrent_threads_soft_limit_ratio_to_cores>2</concurrent_threads_soft_limit_ratio_to_cores>
   ```

4. **Increase system limits:**

   ```bash
   # Increase user process limit
   ulimit -u 100000
   
   # Increase kernel limits
   sysctl -w kernel.threads-max=200000
   ```

## Prevention tips {#prevention-tips-summary}

1. **Set appropriate max_threads:** Don't use default if you have high concurrency
2. **Monitor thread metrics:** Track thread pool usage trends
3. **Configure system limits properly:** Ensure OS limits match workload
4. **Use async inserts:** Reduce thread consumption for insert operations
5. **Implement rate limiting:** Control concurrent query load
6. **Test under load:** Verify thread pool sizing for peak loads
7. **Keep ClickHouse updated:** Concurrency control improvements in newer versions

## Known issues and fixes {#known-issues}

**Issue: Concurrency control broken before October 2024**
- **Affected:** Versions before ~24.10
- **Symptom:** [`concurrent_threads_soft_limit_ratio_to_cores`](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#concurrent_threads_soft_limit_ratio_to_cores) not working
- **Fix:** Merged in October 2024, available in 24.10+
- **Impact:** Thread pool could be exhausted more easily

**Issue: High insert threads with concurrent inserts**
- **Symptom:** Many inserts with [`max_insert_threads`](/operations/settings/settings#max_insert_threads) exhausting pool
- **Cause:** Each insert requesting many threads simultaneously
- **Solution:** Reduce [`max_insert_threads`](/operations/settings/settings#max_insert_threads) or use async inserts

**Issue: Query pipeline executor threads**
- **Symptom:** `QueryPipelineExecutorThreadsActive` reaching pool limit
- **Context:** Modern query execution uses pipeline executor threads
- **Solution:** Proper concurrency control (fixed in 24.10+)

## Diagnosing thread pool exhaustion {#diagnosing}

```sql
-- Snapshot of thread usage at error time
WITH error_times AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT toStartOfMinute(event_time) AS error_minute
    FROM system.query_log
    WHERE exception_code = 439
        AND event_time >= now() - INTERVAL 6 HOUR
)
SELECT 
    m.event_time,
    m.CurrentMetric_GlobalThread AS total_threads,
    m.CurrentMetric_GlobalThreadActive AS active_threads,
    m.CurrentMetric_Query AS concurrent_queries,
    m.CurrentMetric_QueryPipelineExecutorThreads AS executor_threads
FROM system.metric_log m
INNER JOIN error_times e ON toStartOfMinute(m.event_time) = e.error_minute
ORDER BY m.event_time;

-- What was running when error occurred
SELECT 
    user,
    count() AS query_count,
    sum(ProfileEvents['QueryPipelineExecutorThreads']) AS total_threads_requested
FROM system.processes
WHERE query_start_time >= 'time_of_error' - INTERVAL 1 MINUTE
    AND query_start_time <= 'time_of_error' + INTERVAL 1 MINUTE
GROUP BY user
ORDER BY total_threads_requested DESC;
```

## Recommended thread settings {#recommended-settings}

**For high-concurrency workloads:**

```sql
-- Per-query thread limits
SET max_threads = 4;  -- Instead of default (CPU cores)
SET max_insert_threads = 4;

-- Enable concurrency control
-- (server config for 24.10+)
concurrent_threads_soft_limit_ratio_to_cores = 2
```

**For analytical workloads:**

```sql
-- Can use more threads per query
SET max_threads = 16;

-- But limit concurrent queries
SET max_concurrent_queries_for_user = 5;
```

**For mixed workloads:**

```sql
-- Balance between parallelism and concurrency
SET max_threads = 8;
SET max_insert_threads = 4;
SET max_concurrent_queries_for_user = 20;
```

## When to `increase max_thread_pool_size` {#when-to-increase}

Consider increasing if:
- Consistently hitting thread pool limit
- High concurrency is expected workload pattern
- System has sufficient resources (CPU, memory)
- Errors correlate with legitimate traffic spikes

**Don't increase if:**
- System already at resource limits
- Better to reduce per-query thread usage
- Horizontal scaling is an option
- Queries can be optimized to use fewer threads

## Thread pool sizing guidelines {#sizing-guidelines}

```text
Recommended max_thread_pool_size calculation:
= (concurrent_queries × max_threads_per_query) × 1.5 safety margin

Example:
- Expected concurrent queries: 50
- Average max_threads: 8
- Calculation: 50 × 8 × 1.5 = 600 threads

But also consider:
- System CPU cores (more threads than cores causes context switching)
- Available memory (each thread has stack, typically 8-10 MB)
- Background operations (merges, mutations need threads too)
```

## Temporary workarounds {#temporary-workarounds}

While waiting for long-term fixes:

```sql
-- Reduce thread usage across all queries
ALTER SETTINGS PROFILE default SET max_threads = 4;

-- Prioritize critical queries
SELECT * FROM important_table
SETTINGS priority = 1;  -- Higher priority

-- For non-critical queries
SELECT * FROM less_important_table
SETTINGS priority = 10,  -- Lower priority
         max_threads = 2;  -- Fewer threads
```

## For ClickHouse Cloud users {#clickhouse-cloud}

**Limitations:**
- Cannot directly configure [`max_thread_pool_size`](/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings#max_thread_pool_size)
- Thread pool sized by instance tier
- Need to upgrade tier if consistently hitting limits

**Recommendations:**
- Set appropriate [`max_threads`](/operations/settings/settings#max_threads) and [`max_insert_threads`](/operations/settings/settings#max_insert_threads)
- Monitor thread usage metrics
- Scale up tier if thread exhaustion is frequent
- Implement retry logic for transient errors
- Consider horizontal scaling (more replicas)

**Escalation:**
- If errors persist after optimization
- If thread pool appears undersized for tier
- Contact support with thread usage metrics

If you're experiencing this error:
1. Check if this is a transient spike (retry may succeed)
2. Review current thread pool usage in `system.metrics`
3. Check for traffic spike or abnormal query patterns
4. Verify system thread limits are adequate
5. Reduce `max_threads` and `max_insert_threads` if set too high
6. Monitor for queries using excessive threads
7. For persistent issues, increase `max_thread_pool_size` (self-managed) or scale up (Cloud)
8. Ensure concurrency control is working (upgrade to 24.10+ if needed)
9. Implement client-side retry with exponential backoff
