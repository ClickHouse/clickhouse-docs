# Connecting ClickHouse to Querio

Querio is an AI-powered analytics and business intelligence workspace that lets teams query, explore, visualize, and generate insights from data using SQL, Python, and natural language. When you connect Querio to your ClickHouse database or warehouse, you can run live analytics at scale and build boards, notebooks, and AI-assisted reports on your ClickHouse data without moving it.

## Setup ClickHouse for Querio {#setup-clickhouse-for-querio}

### 1. Create a Dedicated User {#create-dedicated-user}

For security best practices, create a dedicated user account exclusively for Querio with minimal required privileges:

```sql
CREATE USER querio_user IDENTIFIED BY 'STRONG_PASSWORD';
```

**Important:** Use a long, random password (at least 16 characters), ideally generated by a password manager.

### 2. Grant Read-Only Database Access {#grant-read-only-access}

Limit Querio's permissions to only the databases and tables it needs to query:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON my_database.* TO querio_user;
```

For specific tables, use:
```sql
GRANT SELECT ON database.table_name TO querio_user;
```

Repeat this process for each database Querio requires access to.

### 3. Gather Connection Details {#gather-connection-details}

To connect Querio to ClickHouse you'll need the following connection info:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `HOST` | The address of your ClickHouse server or cluster |
| `PORT` | Port 9440 (default for secure native protocol) or your configured port |
| `DATABASE` | The database you want Querio to query |
| `USERNAME` | querio_user (or your chosen username) |
| `PASSWORD` | The password for the user account |

**Note:**
- For ClickHouse Cloud, connection details can be found in your cloud console
- For self-managed instances, if your ClickHouse uses a different port, check your server configuration
- Port 9440 is the default for secure native protocol connections
