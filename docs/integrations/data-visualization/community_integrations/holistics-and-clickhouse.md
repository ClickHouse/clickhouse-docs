# Connecting ClickHouse to Holistics

<CommunityMaintainedBadge/>

[Holistics](https://www.holistics.io/) is an AI-native self-service BI platform with a programmable semantic layer for consistent, trustworthy metrics.

By connecting ClickHouse to Holistics, your teams get a fast, reliable AI-powered self-service experience grounded in a code-based semantic layer. Business users can explore data confidently with drag-and-drop and AI, while you keep metric definitions reusable, composable, and version-controlled in Git.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before connecting, ensure you have the following:

- **Permissions:** You must be an Admin in Holistics to add new Data Sources.
- **Network Access:** Your ClickHouse server must be accessible from [Holistics' IP addresses](/docs/connect/ip-whitelisting).
- **Database User:** Create a dedicated, read-only user for Holistics rather than using an admin account.

### Recommended Privileges {#recommended-privileges}

The dedicated user requires `SELECT` privileges on the tables you wish to query, as well as the `system` tables (for schema detection).

```sql
-- Example: Grant read access to a specific database
GRANT SELECT ON my_database.* TO holistics_user;

-- Grant access to system metadata
GRANT SELECT ON system.* TO holistics_user;
```

## Step 1: Gather Connection Details {#step-1-gather-connection-details}

To connect to ClickHouse with HTTP(S) you will need this information:

| **Parameter**     | **Description**                                                                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Host**          | The hostname of your ClickHouse server (e.g., `mz322.eu-central-1.aws.clickhouse.cloud`). |
| **Port**          | **8443** for ClickHouse Cloud (SSL/TLS). **8123** for self-managed instances without SSL. |
| **Database Name** | The name of the database you want to connect to. The default is usually `default`.        |
| **Username**      | The database user. The default is `default`.                                              |
| **Password**      | The password for the database user.                                                       |

You can find these details by clicking the **Connect** button in your ClickHouse Cloud console and selecting **HTTPS**.

## Step 2: Configure Network Access {#step-2-configure-network-access}

Since Holistics is a cloud-based application, its servers must be able to reach your database. You have two options:

1. **Direct Connection (Recommended):** Allowlist Holistics' IP addresses in your firewall or ClickHouse Cloud IP Access List. You can find the list of IPs in the [IP Whitelisting guide](/docs/connect/ip-whitelisting).

2. **Reverse SSH Tunnel:** If your database is in a private network (VPC) and cannot be exposed publicly, use a [Reverse SSH Tunnel](/docs/connect/connect-tunnel).

## Step 3: Add Data Source in Holistics {#step-3-add-data-source-in-holistics}

1. In Holistics, go to **Settings → Data Sources**.

2. Click **New Data Source** and select **ClickHouse**.

3. Fill in the form with the details gathered in Step 1.

   | **Field**         | **Setting**                                                       |
   | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | **Host**          | Your ClickHouse Hostname                                          |
   | **Port**          | `8443` (or `8123`)                                                |
   | **Require SSL**   | Toggle **ON** if using port 8443 (Required for ClickHouse Cloud). |
   | **Database Name** | `default` (or your specific DB)                                   |

   - **Success:** Click **Save**.
   - **Failure:** Check your username/password and ensure the [Holistics IPs are allowlisted](/docs/connect/ip-whitelisting).

## Known Limitations {#known-limitations}

Holistics supports most standard SQL features in ClickHouse, with the following exceptions:

- **Running Total:** This analytic function currently has limited support on ClickHouse.
- **Nested Data Types:** Deeply nested JSON or Array structures may require flattening via SQL models before visualization.

For a full list of supported features, please refer to the [Database-specific Limitations page](/docs/connect/faqs/clickhouse-limitations).
