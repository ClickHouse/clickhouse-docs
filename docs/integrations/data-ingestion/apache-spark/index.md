# Integrating Apache Spark with ClickHouse

<ClickHouseSupportedBadge/>

[Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data
science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.

There are two main ways to connect Apache Spark and ClickHouse:

1. [Spark Connector](./apache-spark/spark-native-connector) - The Spark connector implements the `DataSourceV2` and has its own Catalog
   management. As of today, this is the recommended way to integrate ClickHouse and Spark.
2. [Spark JDBC](./apache-spark/spark-jdbc) - Integrate Spark and ClickHouse
   using a [JDBC data source](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-jdbc.html).

<br/>
<br/>
Both solutions have been successfully tested and are fully compatible with various APIs, including Java, Scala, PySpark, and Spark SQL.
