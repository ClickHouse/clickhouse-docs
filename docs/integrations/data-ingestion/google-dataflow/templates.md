# Google Dataflow templates

<ClickHouseSupportedBadge/>

Google Dataflow templates provide a convenient way to execute prebuilt, ready-to-use data pipelines without the need to write custom code. These templates are designed to simplify common data processing tasks and are built using [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/), leveraging connectors like `ClickHouseIO` for seamless integration with ClickHouse databases. By running these templates on Google Dataflow, you can achieve highly scalable, distributed data processing with minimal effort.

## Why use Dataflow templates? {#why-use-dataflow-templates}

- **Ease of Use**: Templates eliminate the need for coding by offering preconfigured pipelines tailored to specific use cases.
- **Scalability**: Dataflow ensures your pipeline scales efficiently, handling large volumes of data with distributed processing.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for the resources you consume, with the ability to optimize pipeline execution costs.

## How to run Dataflow templates {#how-to-run-dataflow-templates}

As of today, the ClickHouse official template is available via the Google Cloud Console, CLI or Dataflow REST API.
For detailed step-by-step instructions, refer to the [Google Dataflow Run Pipeline From a Template Guide](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/templates/provided-templates).
