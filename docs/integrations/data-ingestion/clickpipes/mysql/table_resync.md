# Resyncing specific tables {#resync-tables}

There are scenarios where it would be useful to have specific tables of a pipe be re-synced. Some sample use-cases could be major schema changes on MySQL, or maybe some data re-modelling on the ClickHouse.

While resyncing individual tables with a button click is a work-in-progress, this guide will share steps on how you can achieve this today in the MySQL ClickPipe.

### 1. Remove the table from the pipe {#removing-table}

This can be followed by following the [table removal guide](./removing_tables).

### 2. Truncate or drop the table on ClickHouse {#truncate-drop-table}

This step is to avoid data duplication when we add this table again in the next step. You can do this by heading over to the **SQL Console** tab in ClickHouse Cloud and running a query.
Note that we have validation to block table addition if the table already exists in ClickHouse and is not empty.

### 3. Add the table to the ClickPipe again {#add-table-again}

This can be followed by following the [table addition guide](./add_table).
