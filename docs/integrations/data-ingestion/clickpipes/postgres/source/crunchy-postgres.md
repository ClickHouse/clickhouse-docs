# Crunchy Bridge Postgres source setup guide

ClickPipes supports Postgres version 12 and later.

## Enable logical replication {#enable-logical-replication}

Crunchy Bridge comes with logical replication enabled by [default](https://docs.crunchybridge.com/how-to/logical-replication). Ensure that the settings below are configured correctly. If not, adjust them accordingly.

```sql
SHOW wal_level; -- should be logical
SHOW max_wal_senders; -- should be 10
SHOW max_replication_slots; -- should be 10
```

## Creating ClickPipes user and granting permissions {#creating-clickpipes-user-and-granting-permissions}

Connect to your Crunchy Bridge Postgres through the `postgres` user and run the below commands:

1. Create a dedicated user for ClickPipes:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER clickpipes_user PASSWORD 'some-password';
    ```

2. Grant schema-level, read-only access to the user you created in the previous step. The following example shows permissions for the `public` schema. Repeat these commands for each schema containing tables you want to replicate:

    ```sql
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "public" TO clickpipes_user;
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "public" TO clickpipes_user;
    ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "public" GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO clickpipes_user;
    ```

3. Grant replication privileges to the user:

    ```sql
     ALTER ROLE clickpipes_user REPLICATION;
    ```

4. Create a [publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) with the tables you want to replicate. We strongly recommend only including the tables you need in the publication to avoid performance overhead.

   :::warning
   Any table included in the publication must either have a **primary key** defined _or_ have its **replica identity** configured to `FULL`. See the [Postgres FAQs](../faq.md#how-should-i-scope-my-publications-when-setting-up-replication) for guidance on scoping.
   :::

   - To create a publication for specific tables:

      ```sql
      CREATE PUBLICATION clickpipes FOR TABLE table_to_replicate, table_to_replicate2;
      ```

   - To create a publication for all tables in a specific schema:

      ```sql
      CREATE PUBLICATION clickpipes FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA "public";
      ```

   The `clickpipes` publication will contain the set of change events generated from the specified tables, and will later be used to ingest the replication stream.

## Safe list ClickPipes IPs {#safe-list-clickpipes-ips}

Safelist [ClickPipes IPs](../../index.md#list-of-static-ips) by adding the Firewall Rules in Crunchy Bridge.

## What's next? {#whats-next}

You can now [create your ClickPipe](../index.md) and start ingesting data from your Postgres instance into ClickHouse Cloud.
Make sure to note down the connection details you used while setting up your Postgres instance as you will need them during the ClickPipe creation process.
