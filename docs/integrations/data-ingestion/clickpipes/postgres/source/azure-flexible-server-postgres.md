# Azure flexible server for Postgres source setup guide

ClickPipes supports Postgres version 12 and later.

## Enable logical replication {#enable-logical-replication}

**You don't need** to follow the below steps if `wal_level` is set to `logical`. This setting should mostly be pre-configured if you are migrating from another data replication tool.

1. Click on the **Server parameters** section

<Image img={server_parameters} alt="Server Parameters in Azure Flexible Server for Postgres" size="lg" border/>

2. Edit the `wal_level` to `logical`

<Image img={wal_level} alt="Change wal_level to logical in Azure Flexible Server for Postgres" size="lg" border/>

3. This change would require a server restart. So restart when requested.

## Creating ClickPipes users and granting permissions {#creating-clickpipes-user-and-granting-permissions}

Connect to your Azure Flexible Server Postgres through the admin user and run the below commands:

1. Create a dedicated user for ClickPipes.

   ```sql
   CREATE USER clickpipes_user PASSWORD 'some-password';
   ```

2. Grant schema-level, read-only access to the user you created in the previous step. The following example shows permissions for the `public` schema. Repeat these commands for each schema containing tables you want to replicate:

   ```sql
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "public" TO clickpipes_user;
   GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "public" TO clickpipes_user;
   ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "public" GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO clickpipes_user;
   ```

3. Grant replication privileges to the user:

   ```sql
   ALTER ROLE clickpipes_user REPLICATION;
   ```

4. Create a [publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) with the tables you want to replicate. We strongly recommend only including the tables you need in the publication to avoid performance overhead.

   :::warning
   Any table included in the publication must either have a **primary key** defined _or_ have its **replica identity** configured to `FULL`. See the [Postgres FAQs](../faq.md#how-should-i-scope-my-publications-when-setting-up-replication) for guidance on scoping.
   :::

   - To create a publication for specific tables:

      ```sql
      CREATE PUBLICATION clickpipes FOR TABLE table_to_replicate, table_to_replicate2;
      ```

   - To create a publication for all tables in a specific schema:

      ```sql
      CREATE PUBLICATION clickpipes FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA "public";
      ```

   The `clickpipes` publication will contain the set of change events generated from the specified tables, and will later be used to ingest the replication stream.

5. Set `wal_sender_timeout` to 0 for `clickpipes_user`

   ```sql
   ALTER ROLE clickpipes_user SET wal_sender_timeout to 0;
   ```

## Add ClickPipes IPs to Firewall {#add-clickpipes-ips-to-firewall}

Please follow the below steps to add [ClickPipes IPs](../../index.md#list-of-static-ips) to your network.

1. Go to the **Networking** tab and add the [ClickPipes IPs](../../index.md#list-of-static-ips) to the Firewall
   of your Azure Flexible Server Postgres OR the Jump Server/Bastion if you are using SSH tunneling.

## What's next? {#whats-next}

You can now [create your ClickPipe](../index.md) and start ingesting data from your Postgres instance into ClickHouse Cloud.
Make sure to note down the connection details you used while setting up your Postgres instance as you will need them during the ClickPipe creation process.
