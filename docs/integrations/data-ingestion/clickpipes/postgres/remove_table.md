In some cases, it makes sense to exclude specific tables from a Postgres ClickPipe - for example, if a table isn't needed for your analytics workload, skipping it can reduce storage and replication costs in ClickHouse.

## Steps to remove specific tables {#remove-tables-steps}

The first step is to remove the table from the pipe. This can be done by the following steps:

1. [Pause](./pause_and_resume.md) the pipe.
2. Click on Edit Table Settings.
3. Locate your table - this can be done by searching it in the search bar.
4. Deselect the table by clicking on the selected checkbox.

5. Click update.
6. Upon successful update, in the **Metrics** tab the status will be **Running**. This table will no longer be replicated by this ClickPipe.
