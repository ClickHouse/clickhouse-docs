# pg_clickhouse

## Introduction {#introduction}

[pg_clickhouse], an open-source PostgreSQL extension, runs analytics queries
on ClickHouse right from PostgreSQL without rewriting any SQL. It supports
PostgreSQL 13 and later and ClickHouse v23 and later.

Once [ClickPipes](/integrations/clickpipes) starts syncing data ClickHouse,
use pg_clickhouse to quickly and easily [import foreign tables] into a
PostgreSQL schema. Then run your existing PostgreSQL queries to against those
tables, preserving your existing code base while pushing execution down to
ClickHouse.

## Getting Started {#getting-started}

The simplest way to try pg_clickhouse is the [Docker image], which
contains the standard PostgreSQL Docker image with the pg_clickhouse
extension:

```sh
docker run --name pg_clickhouse -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my_pass \
       -d ghcr.io/clickhouse/pg_clickhouse:18
docker exec -it pg_clickhouse psql -U postgres -c 'CREATE EXTENSION pg_clickhouse'
```

See the [tutorial] to get started importing ClickHouse tables and pushing down
queries.

## Test Case: TPC-H {#test-case-tpc-h}

This table compares [TPC-H] query performance between regular PostgreSQL
tables and pg_clickhouse connected to ClickHouse, both loaded at scaling
factor 1; ✅ indicates full pushdown, while a dash indicates a query
cancellation after 1m. All tests run on a MacBook Pro M4 Max with 36 GB of
memory.

### Compile From Source {#compile-from-source}

#### General Unix {#general-unix}

The PostgreSQL and curl development packages include `pg_config` and
`curl-config` in the path, so you should be able to just run `make` (or
`gmake`), then `make install`, then in your database
`CREATE EXTENSION pg_clickhouse`.

#### Debian / Ubuntu / APT {#debian--ubuntu--apt}

See [PostgreSQL Apt] for details on pulling from the PostgreSQL Apt repository.

```sh
sudo apt install \
  postgresql-server-18 \
  libcurl4-openssl-dev \
  uuid-dev \
  libssl-dev \
  make \
  cmake \
  g++
```

#### RedHat / CentOS / Yum {#redhat--centos--yum}

```sh
sudo yum install \
  postgresql-server \
  libcurl-devel \
  libuuid-devel \
  openssl-libs \
  automake \
  cmake \
  gcc
```

See [PostgreSQL Yum] for details on pulling from the PostgreSQL Yum repository.

#### Install From PGXN {#install-from-pgxn}

With the above dependencies satisfied use the [PGXN client] (available as
[Homebrew], [Apt] and Yum packages named `pgxnclient`) to download, compile,
and install `pg_clickhouse`:

```sh
pgxn install pg_clickhouse
```

#### Compile and Install {#compile-and-install}

To build and install the ClickHouse library and `pg_clickhouse`, run:

```sh
make
sudo make install
```

<!-- XXX DSO currently disabled.
By default `make` dynamically links the `clickhouse-cpp` library (except on
macOS, where a dynamic `clickhouse-cpp` library is not yet supported). To
statically compile the ClickHouse library into `pg_clickhouse`, pass
`CH_BUILD=static`:

```sh
make CH_BUILD=static
sudo make install CH_BUILD=static
```
 -->

If your host has several PostgreSQL installations, you might need to specify
the appropriate version of `pg_config`:

```sh
export PG_CONFIG=/usr/lib/postgresql/18/bin/pg_config
make
sudo make install
```

If `curl-config` is not in the path on you host, you can specify the path
explicitly:

```sh
export CURL_CONFIG=/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/bin/curl-config
make
sudo make install
```

If you encounter an error such as:

``` text
"Makefile", line 8: Need an operator
```

You need to use GNU make, which may well be installed on your system as
`gmake`:

``` sh
gmake
gmake install
gmake installcheck
```

If you encounter an error such as:

``` text
make: pg_config: Command not found
```

Be sure that you have `pg_config` installed and in your path. If you used a
package management system such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, be sure that the
`-devel` package is also installed. If necessary tell the build process where
to find it:

``` sh
export PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config
make
sudo make install
```

To install the extension in a custom prefix on PostgreSQL 18 or later, pass
the `prefix` argument to `install` (but no other `make` targets):

```sh
sudo make install prefix=/usr/local/extras
```

Then ensure that the prefix is included in the following [`postgresql.conf`
parameters]:

```ini
extension_control_path = '/usr/local/extras/postgresql/share:$system'
dynamic_library_path   = '/usr/local/extras/postgresql/lib:$libdir'
```

#### Testing {#testing}

To run the test suite, once the extension has been installed, run

```sh
make installcheck
```

If you encounter an error such as:

``` text
ERROR:  must be owner of database regression
```

You need to run the test suite using a super user, such as the default
"postgres" super user:

``` sh
make installcheck PGUSER=postgres
```

### Loading {#loading}

Once `pg_clickhouse` is installed, you can add it to a database by connecting
as a super user and running:

``` sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_clickhouse;
```

If you want to install `pg_clickhouse` and all of its supporting objects into
a specific schema, use the `SCHEMA` clause to specify the schema, like so:

``` sql
CREATE SCHEMA env;
CREATE EXTENSION pg_clickhouse SCHEMA env;
```

## Dependencies {#dependencies}

The `pg_clickhouse` extension requires [PostgreSQL] 13 or higher, [libcurl],
[libuuid]. Building the extension requires a C and C++ compiler, [libSSL], [GNU
make], and [CMake].

## Road Map {#road-map}

Our top focus is finishing pushdown coverage for analytic workloads before
adding DML features. Our road map:

*   Get the remaining 10 un-pushed-down TPC-H queries optimally planned
*   Test and fix pushdown for the ClickBench queries
*   Support transparent pushdown of all PostgreSQL aggregate functions
*   Support transparent pushdown of all PostgreSQL functions
*   Allow server-level and session-level ClickHouse settings via CREATE SERVER
    and GUCs
*   Support all ClickHouse data types
*   Support lightweight DELETEs and UPDATEs
*   Support batch insertion via COPY
*   Add a function to execute an arbitrary ClickHouse query and return its
    results as a tables
*   Add support for pushdown of UNION queries when they all query the remote
    database
