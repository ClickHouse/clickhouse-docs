# Working with Date, Time and Timestamp in JDBC

Date, Time and Timestamp require attention because there are several common problems related to them.
The most common problem is how to handle time zones. Another problem is string representation and how to use it.
Besides that, every database and driver has its own specifics and limitations.

This document aims to be a decision-making guide by describing tasks, giving implementation details and explaining problems.

## Timezones {#timezones}

We all know that timezones are hard to handle (daylight saving time, constant offset changes). But this section is about another problem linked to timezones: how they relate to timestamp string representation.

### How ClickHouse converts DateTime strings {#clickhouse-datetime-string-conversion}

ClickHouse uses the following rules to convert `DateTime` string values:

- If a column is defined with a timezone (`DateTime64(9, ‘Asia/Tokyo’)`), then the string value will be treated as a timestamp in that timezone. `2026-01-01 13:00:00` will be `2026-01-01 04:00:00` in `UTC` time.
- If a column has no timezone definition, then only the server timezone is used. Important: the `session_timezone` setting has no effect. So if the server timezone is `UTC` and the session timezone is `America/Los_Angeles`, then `2026-01-01 13:00:00` will be written as `UTC` time.
- When a value is read from a column without a timezone definition, the `session_timezone` is used, or if not set, the server timezone. That is why reading timestamps as strings can be affected by `session_timezone`. There is nothing wrong with this, but it should be kept in mind.

### Writing timestamps across timezones {#writing-timestamps-across-timezones}

Now let’s assume we have an application running in the `us-west` region with local timezone `UTC-8`, and we need to write a local timestamp `2026-01-01 02:00:00` which in `UTC` is `2026-01-01 10:00:00`:

- Writing it as a string requires converting it to the server timezone or column timezone.
- Writing it as a language-native time structure requires the driver to know the target timezone, but:
  - It is not always possible
  - The driver API is not well-designed for this
  - The only way is to describe what transformations will be performed so the application can compensate (or write a Unix timestamp as a number)

### Java and JDBC timestamp APIs {#java-and-jdbc-timestamp-apis}

Java and JDBC have different ways to set a timestamp:

1. Use the `Timestamp` class, which is really a Unix timestamp.
    1. When used with a `Calendar` object, it makes it possible to reinterpret the `Timestamp` in the calendar’s timezone.
    2. `Timestamp` has an internal calendar that is not very obvious.
2. Use the `LocalDateTime` class, which is easy to convert to any timezone, but there is no method allowing you to pass a target timezone.
3. Use the `ZonedDateTime` class, which helps with timezone conversion when writing to a `DateTime` without a timezone (because we know to use the server timezone).
    1. But writing a `ZonedDateTime` to a column with a defined timezone requires the user to compensate for the driver conversion.
4. Use `Long` to write Unix timestamp milliseconds.
5. Use `String` to do all conversions on the application side (which is not very portable).

:::warning
Prefer use of `java.time.ZoneId#of(java.lang.String)` when searching for a timezone by ID.
This method will throw an exception if the timezone is not found (`java.util.TimeZone#getTimeZone(java.lang.String)` will silently fall back to `GMT`).

The correct way to get the `Tokyo` timezone is:

`TimeZone.getTimeZone(ZoneId.of("Asia/Tokyo"))`
:::

## Date {#date}

Dates are timezone-agnostic by nature. There are `Date` and `Date32` types to store dates. Both types use a number of days since Epoch (1970-01-01). `Date` uses only positive numbers of days, so its range ends on `2149-06-06`. `Date32` handles negative numbers of days to cover dates before `1970-01-01`, but its range is smaller (from `1900-01-01` to `2100-01-01`, where 0 is `1970-01-01`). ClickHouse sees `2026-01-01` as `2026-01-01` in any timezone, and there is no timezone parameter for column definitions.

### Using `java.time.LocalDate` {#using-localdate}

In Java, the most suitable class to represent date values is `java.time.LocalDate`. The client uses this class to store the value of `Date` and `Date32` columns (reading `LocalDate.ofEpochDay((long)readUnsignedShortLE())`).

We recommend using `java.time.LocalDate` because it is not affected by timezone transformations and is part of the modern time API.

### Using `java.sql.Date` {#using-java-sql-date}

`LocalDate` was introduced in Java 8. Before that, `java.sql.Date` was used to write/read dates. Internally this class is a wrapper around an instant (a time value representing an absolute point in time). Because of this, `toString()` returns a different date depending on what timezone the JVM is in. It requires the driver to carefully construct values and requires the user to be aware of this.

### Calendar-based reinterpretation {#calendar-based-reinterpretation}

`java.sql.ResultSet` has a method for getting date values that accepts a `Calendar`, and there is a similar method in `java.sql.PreparedStatement`. This was designed to let the JDBC driver reinterpret a date value in the specified timezone. For example, the DB has value `2026-01-01` but the application wants to see this date as midnight in `Tokyo`. That means the returned `java.sql.Date` object will get a specific instant, and when converted to the local timezone it may be a different date because of the time difference. We can achieve the same with `LocalDate` by using `java.time.LocalDate#atStartOfDay(java.time.ZoneId)`.

The ClickHouse JDBC driver always returns a `java.sql.Date` object that points to the **local** date at midnight. In other words, if the date is `2026-01-01`, we mean `2026-01-01 12:00 AM` in the JVM timezone (the same behavior as PostgreSQL and MariaDB JDBC drivers).

## Time {#time}

Time values, like Date values, are timezone-agnostic in most cases. ClickHouse does no transformations of time literal values to any timezone — `’6:30’` is the same wherever it is read.

### ClickHouse Time types {#clickhouse-time-types}

`Time` and `Time64` were introduced in `25.6`. Before that, the timestamp types `DateTime` and `DateTime64` were used instead (discussed later in this guide). `Time` is stored as a 32-bit integer number of seconds and is in the range `[-999:59:59, 999:59:59]`. `Time64` is encoded as an unsigned Decimal64 and stores different time units depending on precision. Common choices are 3 (milliseconds), 6 (microseconds), and 9 (nanoseconds). The precision value range is `[0, 9]`.

### Java type mapping {#java-type-mapping}

The client reads `Time` and `Time64` and stores them as `LocalDateTime`. This is done to support the negative time range (`LocalTime` doesn’t support it). In this case, the date part is the Epoch date `1970-01-01`, so negative values will be before this date.

The main support for time types is implemented using `LocalTime` (when the value is within a day) and `Duration` to use the full range of values. `LocalDateTime` can be used for reading only.

### Using `java.sql.Time` {#using-java-sql-time}

Using `java.sql.Time` is limited to the `LocalTime` range. Internally, `java.sql.Time` is converted to a string literal. The value may be changed by using a Calendar parameter with `PreparedStatement#setTime()`.

### The `toTime` function {#totime-function}

:::note
- `toTime` always requires `Date`, `DateTime`, or another similar type. It does not accept strings. Related issue: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/89896
- It is aliased to [`toTimeWithFixedDate`](/sql-reference/functions/date-time-functions#toTimeWithFixedDate).
- There is a timezone-related issue: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/90310
:::

## Timestamp {#timestamp}

A timestamp is a specific point in time. For example, a Unix timestamp represents any point in time as a number of seconds relative to `1970-01-01 00:00:00` `UTC` (a negative number of seconds represents a timestamp before Unix time, and a positive number represents one after). This representation is easy to calculate and handle if the observer is in the `UTC` timezone or uses it over their local one.

### ClickHouse Timestamp types {#clickhouse-timestamp-types}

There are `DateTime` (32-bit integer, resolution is always seconds) and `DateTime64` (64-bit integer, resolution depends on definition) timestamp types in ClickHouse. Values are always stored as UTC timestamps. This means that when represented as numbers, no timezone conversion is applied.

### String representation and timezone behavior {#string-representation-and-timezone-behavior}

String representation has complexities:

- If no timezone is specified in the column definition and a string is passed on write, it will be converted from the server timezone to a UTC timestamp number. When a value is read from such a column, it will be converted from a UTC timestamp to a literal timestamp using the server or session timezone (a similar approach is applied to timestamp literals in expressions where the timezone is not defined explicitly).
- If a timezone is specified in the column definition, then only that timezone is used in all string conversions. This contradicts the logic when no timezone is specified, so it requires a good understanding of how data is written for each column in the query.
- If a date is passed as a string in a format that includes a timezone, then a conversion function is needed. Usually [`parseDateTimeBestEffort`](/sql-reference/functions/type-conversion-functions#parseDateTimeBestEffort) is used.

### How the JDBC driver handles timestamps {#how-jdbc-driver-handles-timestamps}

In the JDBC driver, we convert timestamps to a numeric representation:

```java
"fromUnixTimestamp64Nano(" + epochSeconds * 1_000_000_000L + nanos + ")"
```

This representation solves most conversion issues with timestamp values because it sends data to the server in a unified format. However, this approach requires a small adjustment in SQL statements, but it provides the simplest and most straightforward way to write timestamps to any column.

`DateTime` and `DateTime64` are read and stored on the client as `java.time.ZonedDateTime`, which helps convert such values to any other timezone (timezone information is preserved).

### Common pitfall with `toDateTime64` {#common-pitfall-todatetime64}

The following code example looks correct but fails on the assertion:

```java
String sql = "SELECT toDateTime64(?, 3)";
try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    LocalDateTime localTs = LocalDateTime.parse("2021-01-01T01:34:56");
    stmt.setObject(1, localTs);
    try (ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery()) {
        rs.next();
        assertEquals(rs.getObject(1, LocalDateTime.class), localTs);
    }
}
```

This happens because `toDateTime64` uses the server timezone and doesn’t know about the source timezone.

## Conversion tables {#conversion-tables}

If a conversion pair is not mentioned in the tables below, then the conversion is not supported. For example, `Date` columns cannot be read as `java.sql.Timestamp` because there is no time part.

### Writing values with `PreparedStatement#setObject` {#writing-values-setobject}

The following table shows how values are converted when set with `PreparedStatement#setObject(column, value)`:

| Class of `value`  | Conversion |
| --- | --- |
| `java.time.LocalDate`  | Formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.  |
| `java.sql.Date`  | Converted with the default calendar and formatted as `LocalDate` (`YYYY-MM-DD`).  |
| `java.time.LocalTime`  | Formatted as `HH:mm:ss`.  |
| `java.time.Duration` | Formatted as `HHH:mm:ss`. Value can be negative. |
| `java.sql.Time` | Converted with the default calendar and formatted as `LocalTime` (`HH:mm`).   |
| `java.time.LocalDateTime`  | Converted to Unix timestamp in nanoseconds and wrapped with `fromUnixTimestamp64Nano`. |
| `java.time.ZonedDateTime`  | Converted to Unix timestamp in nanoseconds and wrapped with `fromUnixTimestamp64Nano`. |
| `java.sql.Timestamp`  | Converted to Unix timestamp in nanoseconds and wrapped with `fromUnixTimestamp64Nano`. |

:::note
The type of the column should be considered unknown. It is up to the application to decide what to pass to the prepared statement.
:::

### Reading values with `ResultSet#getObject` {#reading-values-getobject}

The following table shows how values are converted when read with `ResultSet#getObject(column, class)`:

| ClickHouse Data Type of `column`  | Value of `class`  | Conversion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Date` or `Date32`  | `java.time.LocalDate`  | DB value (number of days) converted to `LocalDate`.  |
| `Date` or `Date32`  | `java.sql.Date`  | DB value (number of days) converted to `LocalDate` and then to `java.sql.Date` using local timezone midnight as the time part. If a calendar is used, its timezone will be used instead of the local one. Example: DB value `1970-01-10` → `LocalDate` is `1970-01-10`.  |
| `Time` or `Time64`  | `java.time.LocalTime`  | DB value converted to `LocalDateTime` and then to `LocalTime`. This works only for time within a day.  |
| `Time` or `Time64`  | `java.time.LocalDateTime`  | DB value converted to `LocalDateTime`.  |
| `Time` or `Time64`  | `java.sql.Time`  | DB value converted to `LocalDateTime` and then to `java.sql.Time` using the default calendar. This works only for time within a day.  |
| `Time` or `Time64`  | `java.time.Duration`  | DB value converted to `LocalDateTime` and then to `Duration`. |
| `DateTime` or `DateTime64`  | `java.time.LocalDateTime` | DB value converted to `ZonedDateTime`, then to `LocalDateTime`. |
| `DateTime` or `DateTime64`  | `java.time.ZonedDateTime` | DB value converted to `ZonedDateTime`.  |
| `DateTime` or `DateTime64`  | `java.sql.Timestamp` | DB value converted to `ZonedDateTime`, then to `java.sql.Timestamp` using the default timezone.  |

### Using Calendar-based methods {#using-calendar-based-methods}

Use `ResultSet#getTime(column, calendar)` and `ResultSet#getDate(column, calendar)` if values were stored using `PreparedStatement#setTime(param, value, calendar)` and `PreparedStatement#setDate(param, value, calendar)` accordingly.
