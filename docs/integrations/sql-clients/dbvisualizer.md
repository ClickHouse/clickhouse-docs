## 3. Connect to ClickHouse {#3-connect-to-clickhouse}

To connect a database with DbVisualizer, you must first create and setup a Database Connection.

1. Create a new connection from **Database->Create Database Connection** and select a driver for your database from the popup menu.

2. An **Object View** tab for the new connection is opened.

3. Enter a name for the connection in the **Name** field, and optionally enter a description of the connection in the **Notes** field.

4. Leave the **Database Type** as **Auto Detect**.

5. If the selected driver in **Driver Type** is marked with a green check mark then it is ready to use. If it is not marked with a green check mark, you may have to configure the driver in the **Driver Manager**.

6. Enter information about the database server in the remaining fields.

7. Verify that a network connection can be established to the specified address and port by clicking the **Ping Server** button.

8. If the result from Ping Server shows that the server can be reached, click **Connect** to connect to the database server.
