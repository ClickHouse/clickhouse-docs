# Using a 3rd-party ETL Tool

<Image img={third_party_01} size='sm' alt='Migrating Self-managed ClickHouse' background='white' />

A great option for moving data from an external data source into ClickHouse is to use one of the many popular ETL and ELT. We have docs that cover the following:

- [Airbyte](/integrations/data-ingestion/etl-tools/airbyte-and-clickhouse.md)
- [dbt](/integrations/data-ingestion/etl-tools/dbt/index.md)
- [Vector](/integrations/data-ingestion/etl-tools/vector-to-clickhouse.md)

But there are many other ETL/ELT tools that integrate with ClickHouse, so check your favorite tool's documentation for details.
