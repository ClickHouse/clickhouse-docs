## When to use the `JSON` Type {#when-to-use-json-type}

The `JSON` type is designed for querying, filtering, and aggregating specific fields within JSON objects that have dynamic or unpredictable structures. It achieves this by splitting JSON objects into separate sub-columns, which dramatically reduces data read and speeds up queries on selected fields compared to alternatives like `Map` or parsing strings.

**However, this comes with important trade-offs:**

- Slower `INSERT`s - Splitting JSON into sub-columns, performing type inference, and managing flexible storage structures makes inserts slower compared to storing JSON as a simple `String` column.
- Slower when reading entire objects - If you need to retrieve complete JSON documents (rather than specific fields), the `JSON` type is slower than reading from a `String` column. The overhead of reconstructing objects from separate sub-columns provides no benefit when you're not doing field-level queries.
- Storage overhead - Maintaining separate sub-columns adds structural overhead compared to storing JSON as a single string value.

### Use the `JSON` type when: {#use-json-type}

- Your data has a dynamic or unpredictable structure with varying keys across documents
- Field types or schemas change over time or vary between records
- You need to query, filter, or aggregate on specific paths within JSON objects whose structure you cannot predict upfront
- Your use case involves semi-structured data like logs, events, or user-generated content with inconsistent schemas

### Use a `String` column (or structured types) when: {#use-string-type}
- Your data structure is known and consistent - in this case, use normal columns, `Nested`, `Tuple`, `Array`, `Dynamic`, or `Variant` types instead
- `JSON` documents are treated as opaque blobs that are only stored and retrieved in their entirety without field-level analysis
- You don't need to query or filter on individual JSON fields within the database
- The `JSON` is simply a transport/storage format, not analyzed within ClickHouse

:::tip
If `JSON` is an opaque document that is not analyzed inside the database, and only stored and retrieved back, it should be stored as a `String` field. The `JSON` type's benefits only materialize when you need to efficiently query, filter, or aggregate on specific fields within dynamic `JSON` structures.

You can also mix approaches—use standard columns for predictable top-level fields and a `JSON` column for dynamic sections of the payload.
