_This guide is compatible with ClickHouse Cloud and for self-hosted ClickHouse v23.5+._

This guide shows how to migrate data from [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) to ClickHouse.

We first export a table to [Google's object store (GCS)](https://cloud.google.com/storage) and then import that data into [ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.com/cloud). These steps need to be repeated for each table you wish to export from BigQuery to ClickHouse.

## How long will exporting data to ClickHouse take? 

Exporting data from BigQuery to ClickHouse is dependent on the size of your dataset. As a comparison, it takes about an hour to export the [4TB public Ethereum dataset](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/ethereum-bigquery-public-dataset-smart-contract-analytics) from BigQuery to ClickHouse using this guide.

## 1. Export table data to GCS 

In this step, we utilize the [BigQuery SQL workspace](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bigquery-web-ui) to execute our SQL commands. Below, we export a BigQuery table named `mytable` to a GCS bucket using the [`EXPORT DATA`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/other-statements) statement.

```sql
DECLARE export_path STRING;
DECLARE n INT64;
DECLARE i INT64;
SET i = 0;

-- We recommend setting n to correspond to x billion rows. So 5 billion rows, n = 5
SET n = 100;

WHILE i < n DO
  SET export_path = CONCAT('gs://mybucket/mytable/', i,'-*.parquet');
  EXPORT DATA
    OPTIONS (
      uri = export_path,
      format = 'PARQUET',
      overwrite = true
    )
  AS (
    SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE export_id = i
  );
  SET i = i + 1;
END WHILE;
```

In the above query, we export our BigQuery table to the [Parquet data format](https://parquet.apache.org/). We also have a `*` character in our `uri` parameter. This ensures the output is sharded into multiple files, with a numerically increasing suffix, should the export exceed 1GB of data.

This approach has a number of advantages:

- Google allows up to 50TB per day to be exported to GCS for free. Users only pay for GCS storage.
- Exports produce multiple files automatically, limiting each to a maximum of 1GB of table data. This is beneficial to ClickHouse since it allows imports to be parallelized.
- Parquet, as a column-oriented format, represents a better interchange format since it is inherently compressed and faster for BigQuery to export and ClickHouse to query

## 2. Importing data into ClickHouse from GCS 

Once the export is complete, we can import this data into a ClickHouse table. You can use the [ClickHouse SQL console](/integrations/sql-clients/sql-console) or [`clickhouse-client`](/interfaces/cli) to execute the commands below.

You must first [create your table](/sql-reference/statements/create/table) in ClickHouse:

```sql
-- If your BigQuery table contains a column of type STRUCT, you must enable this setting
-- to map that column to a ClickHouse column of type Nested
SET input_format_parquet_import_nested = 1;

CREATE TABLE default.mytable
(
        `timestamp` DateTime64(6),
        `some_text` String
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (timestamp);
```

After creating the table, enable the setting `parallel_distributed_insert_select` if you have multiple ClickHouse replicas in your cluster to speed up our export. If you only have one ClickHouse node, you can skip this step:

```sql
SET parallel_distributed_insert_select = 1;
```

Finally, we can insert the data from GCS into our ClickHouse table using the [`INSERT INTO SELECT` command](/sql-reference/statements/insert-into#inserting-the-results-of-select), which inserts data into a table based on the results from a `SELECT` query.

To retrieve the data to `INSERT`, we can use the [s3Cluster function](/sql-reference/table-functions/s3Cluster) to retrieve data from our GCS bucket since GCS is interoperable with [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). If you only have one ClickHouse node, you can use the [s3 table function](/sql-reference/table-functions/s3) instead of the `s3Cluster` function.

```sql
INSERT INTO mytable
SELECT
    timestamp,
    ifNull(some_text, '') as some_text
FROM s3Cluster(
    'default',
    'https://storage.googleapis.com/mybucket/mytable/*.parquet.gz',
    '<ACCESS_ID>',
    '<SECRET>'
);
```

The `ACCESS_ID` and `SECRET` used in the above query is your [HMAC key](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/hmackeys) associated with your GCS bucket.

:::note Use `ifNull` when exporting nullable columns
In the above query, we use the [`ifNull` function](/sql-reference/functions/functions-for-nulls#ifnull) with the `some_text` column to insert data into our ClickHouse table with a default value. You can also make your columns in ClickHouse [`Nullable`](/sql-reference/data-types/nullable), but this is not recommended as it may affect negatively performance.

Alternatively, you can `SET input_format_null_as_default=1` and any missing or NULL values will be replaced by default values for their respective columns, if those defaults are specified.

## 3. Testing successful data export 

To test whether your data was properly inserted, simply run a `SELECT` query on your new table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM mytable limit 10;
```

To export more BigQuery tables, simply redo the steps above for each additional table.
