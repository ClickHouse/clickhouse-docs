ClickHouse now offers a native JSON column type designed for semi-structured and dynamic data. It's important to clarify that **this is a column type, not a data format**—you can insert JSON into ClickHouse as a string or via supported formats like [JSONEachRow](/docs/interfaces/formats/JSONEachRow), but that does not imply using the JSON column type. Users should only use the JSON type when the structure of their data is dynamic, not when they simply happen to store JSON.

## When to use the JSON type \{#when-to-use-the-json-type}

Use the JSON type when your data:

* Has **unpredictable keys** that can change over time.
* Contains **values with varying types** (e.g., a path might sometimes contain a string, sometimes a number).
* Requires schema flexibility where strict typing isn't viable.

If your data structure is known and consistent, there is rarely a need for the JSON type, even if your data is in JSON format. Specifically, if your data has:

* **A flat structure with known keys**: use standard column types e.g. String.
* **Predictable nesting**: use Tuple, Array, or Nested types for these structures.
* **Predictable structure with varying types**: consider Dynamic or Variant types instead.

You can also mix approaches - for example, use static columns for predictable top-level fields and a single JSON column for a dynamic section of the payload.

## Considerations and tips for using JSON \{#considerations-and-tips-for-using-json}

The JSON type enables efficient columnar storage by flattening paths into subcolumns. But with flexibility comes responsibility. To use it effectively:

* **Specify path types** using [hints in the column definition](/sql-reference/data-types/newjson) to specify types for known sub columns, avoiding unnecessary type inference. 
* **Skip paths** if you don't need the values, with [SKIP and SKIP REGEXP](/sql-reference/data-types/newjson) to reduce storage and improve performance.
* **Avoid setting [`max_dynamic_paths`](/sql-reference/data-types/newjson#reaching-the-limit-of-dynamic-paths-inside-json) too high** - large values increase resource consumption and reduce efficiency. As a rule of thumb, keep it below 10,000.

:::note[Type hints ]
Type hits offer more than just a way to avoid unnecessary type inference - they eliminate storage and processing indirection entirely. JSON paths with type hints are always stored just like traditional columns, bypassing the need for [**discriminator columns**](https://clickhouse.com/blog/a-new-powerful-json-data-type-for-clickhouse#storage-extension-for-dynamically-changing-data) or dynamic resolution during query time. This means that with well-defined type hints, nested JSON fields achieve the same performance and efficiency as if they were modeled as top-level fields from the outset. As a result, for datasets that are mostly consistent but still benefit from the flexibility of JSON, type hints provide a convenient way to preserve performance without needing to restructure your schema or ingest pipeline.
:::

## Advanced Features \{#advanced-features}

* JSON columns **can be used in primary keys** like any other columns. Codecs cannot be specified for a sub-column.
* They support introspection via functions like [`JSONAllPathsWithTypes()` and `JSONDynamicPaths()`](/sql-reference/data-types/newjson#introspection-functions).
* You can read nested sub-objects using the `.^` syntax.
* Query syntax may differ from standard SQL and may require special casting or operators for nested fields.

For additional guidance, see[ ClickHouse JSON documentation](/sql-reference/data-types/newjson) or explore our blog post[ A New Powerful JSON Data Type for ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/blog/a-new-powerful-json-data-type-for-clickhouse).

## Examples \{#examples}

Consider the following JSON sample, representing a row from the [Python PyPI dataset](https://clickpy.clickhouse.com/):

```json
{
  "date": "2022-11-15",
  "country_code": "ES",
  "project": "clickhouse-connect",
  "type": "bdist_wheel",
  "installer": "pip",
  "python_minor": "3.9",
  "system": "Linux",
  "version": "0.3.0"
}
```

Lets assume this schema is static and the types can be well defined. Even if the data is in NDJSON format (JSON row per line), there is no need to use the JSON type for such a schema. Simply define the schema with classic types.

```sql
CREATE TABLE pypi (
  `date` Date,
  `country_code` String,
  `project` String,
  `type` String,
  `installer` String,
  `python_minor` String,
  `system` String,
  `version` String
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (project, date)
```

and insert JSON rows:

```sql
INSERT INTO pypi FORMAT JSONEachRow
{"date":"2022-11-15","country_code":"ES","project":"clickhouse-connect","type":"bdist_wheel","installer":"pip","python_minor":"3.9","system":"Linux","version":"0.3.0"}
```

Consider the [arXiv dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv?resource=download) containing 2.5m scholarly papers. Each row in this dataset, distributed as NDJSON, represents a published academic paper. An example row is shown below:

```json
{
  "id": "2101.11408",
  "submitter": "Daniel Lemire",
  "authors": "Daniel Lemire",
  "title": "Number Parsing at a Gigabyte per Second",
  "comments": "Software at https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float and\n  https://github.com/lemire/simple_fastfloat_benchmark/",
  "journal-ref": "Software: Practice and Experience 51 (8), 2021",
  "doi": "10.1002/spe.2984",
  "report-no": null,
  "categories": "cs.DS cs.MS",
  "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",
  "abstract": "With disks and networks providing gigabytes per second ....\n",
  "versions": [
    {
      "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2021 20:31:27 GMT",
      "version": "v1"
    },
    {
      "created": "Sat, 30 Jan 2021 23:57:29 GMT",
      "version": "v2"
    }
  ],
  "update_date": "2022-11-07",
  "authors_parsed": [
    [
      "Lemire",
      "Daniel",
      ""
    ]
  ]
}
```

While the JSON here is complex, with nested structures, it is predictable. The number and type of the fields will not change. While we could use the JSON type for this example, we can also just define the structure explicitly using [Tuples](/sql-reference/data-types/tuple) and [Nested](/sql-reference/data-types/nested-data-structures/nested) types:

```sql
CREATE TABLE arxiv
(
  `id` String,
  `submitter` String,
  `authors` String,
  `title` String,
  `comments` String,
  `journal-ref` String,
  `doi` String,
  `report-no` String,
  `categories` String,
  `license` String,
  `abstract` String,
  `versions` Array(Tuple(created String, version String)),
  `update_date` Date,
  `authors_parsed` Array(Array(String))
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY update_date
```

Again we can insert the data as JSON:

```sql
INSERT INTO arxiv FORMAT JSONEachRow 
{"id":"2101.11408","submitter":"Daniel Lemire","authors":"Daniel Lemire","title":"Number Parsing at a Gigabyte per Second","comments":"Software at https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float and\n  https://github.com/lemire/simple_fastfloat_benchmark/","journal-ref":"Software: Practice and Experience 51 (8), 2021","doi":"10.1002/spe.2984","report-no":null,"categories":"cs.DS cs.MS","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","abstract":"With disks and networks providing gigabytes per second ....\n","versions":[{"created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 20:31:27 GMT","version":"v1"},{"created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 23:57:29 GMT","version":"v2"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07","authors_parsed":[["Lemire","Daniel",""]]}
```

Suppose another column called `tags` is added. If this was simply a list of strings we could model as an `Array(String)`, but let's assume users can add arbitrary tag structures with mixed types (notice score is a string or integer). Our modified JSON document:

```sql
{
 "id": "2101.11408",
 "submitter": "Daniel Lemire",
 "authors": "Daniel Lemire",
 "title": "Number Parsing at a Gigabyte per Second",
 "comments": "Software at https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float and\n  https://github.com/lemire/simple_fastfloat_benchmark/",
 "journal-ref": "Software: Practice and Experience 51 (8), 2021",
 "doi": "10.1002/spe.2984",
 "report-no": null,
 "categories": "cs.DS cs.MS",
 "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",
 "abstract": "With disks and networks providing gigabytes per second ....\n",
 "versions": [
 {
   "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2021 20:31:27 GMT",
   "version": "v1"
 },
 {
   "created": "Sat, 30 Jan 2021 23:57:29 GMT",
   "version": "v2"
 }
 ],
 "update_date": "2022-11-07",
 "authors_parsed": [
 [
   "Lemire",
   "Daniel",
   ""
 ]
 ],
 "tags": {
   "tag_1": {
     "name": "ClickHouse user",
     "score": "A+",
     "comment": "A good read, applicable to ClickHouse"
   },
   "28_03_2025": {
     "name": "professor X",
     "score": 10,
     "comment": "Didn't learn much",
     "updates": [
       {
         "name": "professor X",
         "comment": "Wolverine found more interesting"
       }
     ]
   }
 }
}
```

In this case, we could model the arXiv documents as either all JSON or simply add a JSON `tags` column. We provide both examples below:


```sql
CREATE TABLE arxiv
(
  `doc` JSON(update_date Date)
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY doc.update_date
```

:::note
We provide a type hint for the `update_date` column in the JSON definition, as we use it in the ordering/primary key. This helps ClickHouse to know that this column won't be null and ensures it knows which `update_date` sub-column to use (there may be multiple for each type, so this is ambiguous otherwise).
:::

We can insert into this table and view the subsequently inferred schema using the [`JSONAllPathsWithTypes`](/sql-reference/functions/json-functions#jsonallpathswithtypes) function and [`PrettyJSONEachRow`](/interfaces/formats/PrettyJSONEachRow) output format:

```sql
INSERT INTO arxiv FORMAT JSONAsObject 
{"id":"2101.11408","submitter":"Daniel Lemire","authors":"Daniel Lemire","title":"Number Parsing at a Gigabyte per Second","comments":"Software at https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float and\n  https://github.com/lemire/simple_fastfloat_benchmark/","journal-ref":"Software: Practice and Experience 51 (8), 2021","doi":"10.1002/spe.2984","report-no":null,"categories":"cs.DS cs.MS","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","abstract":"With disks and networks providing gigabytes per second ....\n","versions":[{"created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 20:31:27 GMT","version":"v1"},{"created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 23:57:29 GMT","version":"v2"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07","authors_parsed":[["Lemire","Daniel",""]],"tags":{"tag_1":{"name":"ClickHouse user","score":"A+","comment":"A good read, applicable to ClickHouse"},"28_03_2025":{"name":"professor X","score":10,"comment":"Didn't learn much","updates":[{"name":"professor X","comment":"Wolverine found more interesting"}]}}}
```

```sql
SELECT JSONAllPathsWithTypes(doc)
FROM arxiv
FORMAT PrettyJSONEachRow

{
  "JSONAllPathsWithTypes(doc)": {
    "abstract": "String",
    "authors": "String",
    "authors_parsed": "Array(Array(Nullable(String)))",
    "categories": "String",
    "comments": "String",
    "doi": "String",
    "id": "String",
    "journal-ref": "String",
    "license": "String",
    "submitter": "String",
    "tags.28_03_2025.comment": "String",
    "tags.28_03_2025.name": "String",
    "tags.28_03_2025.score": "Int64",
    "tags.28_03_2025.updates": "Array(JSON(max_dynamic_types=16, max_dynamic_paths=256))",
    "tags.tag_1.comment": "String",
    "tags.tag_1.name": "String",
    "tags.tag_1.score": "String",
    "title": "String",
    "update_date": "Date",
    "versions": "Array(JSON(max_dynamic_types=16, max_dynamic_paths=256))"
  }
}

1 row in set. Elapsed: 0.003 sec.
```

Alternatively, we could model this using our earlier schema and a JSON `tags` column. This is generally preferred, minimizing the inference required by ClickHouse:

```sql
CREATE TABLE arxiv
(
    `id` String,
    `submitter` String,
    `authors` String,
    `title` String,
    `comments` String,
    `journal-ref` String,
    `doi` String,
    `report-no` String,
    `categories` String,
    `license` String,
    `abstract` String,
    `versions` Array(Tuple(created String, version String)),
    `update_date` Date,
    `authors_parsed` Array(Array(String)),
    `tags` JSON()
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY update_date
```

```sql
INSERT INTO arxiv FORMAT JSONEachRow 
{"id":"2101.11408","submitter":"Daniel Lemire","authors":"Daniel Lemire","title":"Number Parsing at a Gigabyte per Second","comments":"Software at https://github.com/fastfloat/fast_float and\n  https://github.com/lemire/simple_fastfloat_benchmark/","journal-ref":"Software: Practice and Experience 51 (8), 2021","doi":"10.1002/spe.2984","report-no":null,"categories":"cs.DS cs.MS","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","abstract":"With disks and networks providing gigabytes per second ....\n","versions":[{"created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 20:31:27 GMT","version":"v1"},{"created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 23:57:29 GMT","version":"v2"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07","authors_parsed":[["Lemire","Daniel",""]],"tags":{"tag_1":{"name":"ClickHouse user","score":"A+","comment":"A good read, applicable to ClickHouse"},"28_03_2025":{"name":"professor X","score":10,"comment":"Didn't learn much","updates":[{"name":"professor X","comment":"Wolverine found more interesting"}]}}}
```

We can now infer the types of the sub column tags.

```sql
SELECT JSONAllPathsWithTypes(tags)
FROM arxiv
FORMAT PrettyJSONEachRow

{
  "JSONAllPathsWithTypes(tags)": {
    "28_03_2025.comment": "String",
    "28_03_2025.name": "String",
    "28_03_2025.score": "Int64",
    "28_03_2025.updates": "Array(JSON(max_dynamic_types=16, max_dynamic_paths=256))",
    "tag_1.comment": "String",
    "tag_1.name": "String",
    "tag_1.score": "String"
  }
}

1 row in set. Elapsed: 0.002 sec.
```
