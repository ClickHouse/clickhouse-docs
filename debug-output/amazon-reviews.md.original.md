This dataset contains over 150M customer reviews of Amazon products. The data is in snappy-compressed Parquet files in AWS S3 that total 49GB in size (compressed). Let's walk through the steps to insert it into ClickHouse.

:::note
The queries below were executed on a **Production** instance of ClickHouse Cloud. For more information see
["Playground specifications"](/getting-started/playground#specifications).

## Loading the dataset \{#loading-the-dataset}

1. Without inserting the data into ClickHouse, we can query it in place. Let's grab some rows, so we can see what they look like:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM s3('https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/amazon_reviews/amazon_reviews_2015.snappy.parquet')
LIMIT 3
```

The rows look like:

```response

review_headline:   but overall this case is pretty sturdy and provides good protection for the phone
review_body:       The front piece was a little difficult to secure to the phone at first, but overall this case is pretty sturdy and provides good protection for the phone, which is what I need. I would buy this case again.
```

2. Let's define a new `MergeTree` table named `amazon_reviews` to store this data in ClickHouse:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE amazon

CREATE TABLE amazon.amazon_reviews
(
    `review_date` Date,
    `marketplace` LowCardinality(String),
    `customer_id` UInt64,
    `review_id` String,
    `product_id` String,
    `product_parent` UInt64,
    `product_title` String,
    `product_category` LowCardinality(String),
    `star_rating` UInt8,
    `helpful_votes` UInt32,
    `total_votes` UInt32,
    `vine` Bool,
    `verified_purchase` Bool,
    `review_headline` String,
    `review_body` String,
    PROJECTION helpful_votes
    (
        SELECT *
        ORDER BY helpful_votes
    )
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
ORDER BY (review_date, product_category)
```

3. The following `INSERT` command uses the `s3Cluster` table function, which allows the processing of multiple S3 files in parallel using all the nodes of your cluster. We also use a wildcard to insert any file that starts with the name `https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/amazon_reviews/amazon_reviews_*.snappy.parquet`:

```sql
INSERT INTO amazon.amazon_reviews SELECT *
FROM s3Cluster('default', 
'https://datasets-documentation.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/amazon_reviews/amazon_reviews_*.snappy.parquet')
```

:::tip
In ClickHouse Cloud, the name of the cluster is `default`. Change `default` to the name of your cluster...or use the `s3` table function (instead of `s3Cluster`) if you do not have a cluster.

5. That query doesn't take long - averaging about 300,000 rows per second. Within 5 minutes or so you should see all the rows inserted:

```sql runnable
SELECT formatReadableQuantity(count())
FROM amazon.amazon_reviews
```

6. Let's see how much space our data is using:

```sql runnable
SELECT
    disk_name,
    formatReadableSize(sum(data_compressed_bytes) AS size) AS compressed,
    formatReadableSize(sum(data_uncompressed_bytes) AS usize) AS uncompressed,
    round(usize / size, 2) AS compr_rate,
    sum(rows) AS rows,
    count() AS part_count
FROM system.parts
WHERE (active = 1) AND (table = 'amazon_reviews')
GROUP BY disk_name
ORDER BY size DESC
```

The original data was about 70G, but compressed in ClickHouse it takes up about 30G.


## Example queries \{#example-queries}

7. Let's run some queries. Here are the top 10 most-helpful reviews in the dataset:

```sql runnable
SELECT
    product_title,
    review_headline
FROM amazon.amazon_reviews
ORDER BY helpful_votes DESC
LIMIT 10
```

:::note
This query is using a [projection](/data-modeling/projections) to speed up performance.
:::

8. Here are the top 10 products in Amazon with the most reviews:

```sql runnable
SELECT
    any(product_title),
    count()
FROM amazon.amazon_reviews
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

9. Here are the average review ratings per month for each product (an actual [Amazon job interview question](https://datalemur.com/questions/sql-avg-review-ratings)!):

```sql runnable
SELECT
    toStartOfMonth(review_date) AS month,
    any(product_title),
    avg(star_rating) AS avg_stars
FROM amazon.amazon_reviews
GROUP BY
    month,
    product_id
ORDER BY
    month DESC,
    product_id ASC
LIMIT 20;
```

10. Here are the total number of votes per product category. This query is fast because `product_category` is in the primary key:

```sql runnable
SELECT
    sum(total_votes),
    product_category
FROM amazon.amazon_reviews
GROUP BY product_category
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

11. Let's find the products with the word **"awful"** occurring most frequently in the review. This is a big task - over 151M strings have to be parsed looking for a single word:

```sql runnable settings={'enable_parallel_replicas':1}
SELECT
    product_id,
    any(product_title),
    avg(star_rating),
    count() AS count
FROM amazon.amazon_reviews
WHERE position(review_body, 'awful') > 0
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

Notice the query time for such a large amount of data. The results are also a fun read!

12. We can run the same query again, except this time we search for **awesome** in the reviews:

```sql runnable settings={'enable_parallel_replicas':1}
SELECT 
    product_id,
    any(product_title),
    avg(star_rating),
    count() AS count
FROM amazon.amazon_reviews
WHERE position(review_body, 'awesome') > 0
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 50;
```
