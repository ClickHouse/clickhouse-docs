# This job checks the docs for broken links.  Most of the links in the
# docs are to markdown files, and those get checked by Docusaurus, but
# there are some links to partner websites, wikipedia, GitHub, etc.
#
# The job writes to a file that you can find by looking at the Actions
# page in GitHub.  You should look at it once in a while.
